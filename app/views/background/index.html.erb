  <p>This
  project began when David Moberly, then an M.A. student at the University of
  Nebraska-Lincoln [UNL] (and currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Minnesota)
  approached me at the suggestion of Steve Ramsay (Susan J. Rosowski Associate Professor
  of English, UNL) about my interest in data-mining Jane Austen. Our first idea,
  checking Austen&rsquo;s words against those of the Anglican liturgy and the King James
  Bible, was a bust, as Austen tended <i>not</i> to use the exact words of liturgy or scripture to avoid irreverence.
  But with the help of Brian Pytlig Zillig of UNL&rsquo;s Center for Digital
  Research in the Humanities [CDRH] and Professor of Libraries, and his brainchild,
  TokenX, a text visualization, analysis, and play tool, we began to look for patterns of
  speech in Austen, first with <i>Pride and
  Prejudice</i> [<i>PP</i>]. David coded all the dialogue of the novel,
  at which point we began to see how interesting results of this sort could be.
  </p>

  <h4 id="beginnings">Beginnings <span class="back_to_top">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</span></h4>

  <p>The size
  of Austen&rsquo;s corpus, only six completed major novels, seems to augur against
  successful data-mining or &ldquo;distant reading,&rdquo; as an ordinary person can read
  all six for him or herself and presumably note important features of diction without
  the aid of computational analysis. And yet we found even at this early stage that
  there were tantalizing results of the sort which ordinary readers would indeed miss.
  TokenX works through creating frequency tables. By sorting for unique
  utterances of a given character (or type of character, such as &ldquo;female&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;male&rdquo;), one could see, for instance, that Elizabeth Bennet is the only
  character in <i>PP</i> to use the
  words &ldquo;friendship,&rdquo; &ldquo;merit,&rdquo; &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; (four times
  each) and &ldquo;affections&rdquo; and &ldquo;disdain&rdquo; (three times each), while
  Darcy is the only character to use &ldquo;abhorrence,&rdquo; &ldquo;confession,&rdquo;
  &ldquo;insufficient,&rdquo; and &ldquo;offenses&rdquo; (he uses each three times).
  In fact, one can make a kind of impressionistic picture of his character by
  listing some of the words Darcy alone uses (in these cases, twice each):
  <i>accusations, carelessness, catch, consulting,
  defiance, existing, explaining, faithful, indirect, lessen, liberally, meanly, motives,
  offers, purposely, repetition, school,</i> and <i>support</i>. Words unique to the narrator are perhaps
  less surprising, as many of them are words that set the stage or describe action, such
  as &ldquo;followed&rdquo; (25 times), &ldquo;breakfast&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;listened&rdquo; (20 times each), and &ldquo;pause&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;seated&rdquo; (15 times each). Much later in our project, Steve Ramsay
  would find that running similarity algorithms on the vocabulary of the characters
  in <i>PP</i> reveals that the
  narrator, Elizabeth, and Darcy are more similar to each other in the words they use
  than they are to any other character. The surprise is that Mr. Collins also
  shares an enormous amount of vocabulary with this group, only slightly less than
  Elizabeth shares with Jane, her own sister. Users may wish to create wordclouds
  from the frequency tables of unique utterances to create a rendering of a given
  character, such as Darcy&rsquo;s.</p>

  <h4 id="traits">Traits <span class="back_to_top">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</span></h4>

  <p>From the
  beginning, we aimed to search not just for individual speech but patterns of speech
  among classes of characters. We assigned traits of gender, age, marital status,
  class, occupation, and kind of character. The categories within the traits are
  listed below.</p>


  <ul class="c19 lst-kix_list_7-0 start">
    <li><a href="#gender">Gender:</a> male, female</li>

    <li><a href="#age">Age:</a> child, young and marriageable ("out"), young married, middle-aged, old, and deceased</li>

    <li><a href="#marital">Marital:</a> married, unmarried, married during the novel's action (&ldquo;mda&rdquo;), widowed</li>

    <li><a href="#class">Class:</a> aristocrat, landed gentry, gentry, professional class, working class</li>

    <li><a href="#occupation">Occupation:</a> clergyman, doctor, nurse, lawyer, naval officer, army officer, servant, and farmer</li>

    <li><a href="#kind">Kind of Character:</a> hero, heroine, cad, fool, heir, neutral, narrator</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="gender">Gender</h5>


  <p>Assigning gender is unproblematic
  in Austen&rsquo;s novels. Some of the more interesting results arise through
  searching by gender. For instance, we found that in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> no female character uses the
  word &ldquo;matrimony&rdquo; while no male character uses the word
  &ldquo;wedding.&rdquo;</p>

  <h5 id="age">Age</h5>

  <p>While
  &ldquo;out&rdquo; in Austen&rsquo;s day described only young women of marriageable age,
  we found it a handy (and short) code for both marriageable male and female characters
  (the chief actors in most of the novels). Age is sometimes hard to
  discern&mdash;for instance, is Mrs. Weston of <i>Emma</i> [<i>E</i>] &ldquo;young married&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;middle-aged&rdquo;? We have coded her as &ldquo;young married,&rdquo;
  partly because she becomes pregnant and has a child within the action of the story.
  One would think that &ldquo;deceased&rdquo; would not be a necessary category,
  but there are points in which now-dead characters speak through indirect diction within
  the speech of the narrator or that of living characters.</p>

  <h5 id="marital">Marital Status</h5>

  <p>Many
  characters marry during the course of the action, and so we have coded them as
  &ldquo;married during action&rdquo; or &ldquo;mda&rdquo; (examples include Mr. Elton
  in <i>Emma</i> and Maria and Mr. Rushworth
  in <i>Persuasion</i> [<i>P</i>]). Users may wish to play with this designation if
  they are more interested in one stage of the character&rsquo;s life over the other (for
  instance, one can search for Mr. Elton alongside unmarried characters or married ones).
  </p>

  <h5 id="class">Class</h5>

  <p>As many
  critics have noted, Austen&rsquo;s world is focused on the gentry and professional
  classes, with few aristocrats and a limited depiction of servants and other members of
  the working classes. Working-class speech, we found, was very rare. We
  assigned married female characters the class status and occupation status of their
  husbands, as reflects the social laws of Austen&rsquo;s day; Mrs. Gardiner, for
  instance, has the class standing of her husband, a lawyer, and thus belongs to the
  professional class. However, assigning class rank for married women based on
  their husband&rsquo;s class becomes more problematic with characters who marry within
  the course of the novel (for instance, Lydia Bennet of <i>PP</i> is coded as &ldquo;landed gentry&rdquo; even
  though for several chapters at the end of the novel she has become a member of the
  professional classes, married as she is to an army officer, worthless though he might
  be).</p>

  <h5 id="occupation">Occupation</h5>
  
  <p>The
  range of occupations of Austen&rsquo;s speaking characters is limited: clergyman
  (Austen&rsquo;s clergymen are always Anglican priests), doctor, nurse, lawyer, naval
  officer, army officer, servant, and farmer. Most of her characters do not have any
  occupation at all, including almost all of the women. </p>

  <h5 id="kind">Kind of Character</h5>
  
  <p>This
  trait is perhaps the most open to readerly interpretation. In most cases,
  assigning the hero and heroine is readily done. We judged that both Marianne and
  Elinor Dashwood in <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> [<i>SS</i>] as well as Elizabeth
  and Jane Bennet in <i>PP</i> are heroines;
  likewise, Colonel Brandon and Edward Ferrars (<i>SS</i>) and Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley
  (<i>PP</i>) are coded as heroes.
  There is one cad in each novel. There are more fools than any other sort of
  character; &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; was assigned to those relatively rare characters such
  as Mrs. Weston (<i>E</i>) or Mrs. Gardiner
  (<i>PP</i>) who are reasonably wise and
  decent people. We have included the category of &ldquo;heir&rdquo; because five
  of the six novels feature a major character who is marked as being the heir of a
  substantial property and/or title (Henry Tilney in <i>Northanger Abbey</i> [<i>NA</i>], 
    Mr. Collins [<i>PP</i>], Edward Ferrars [<i>SS</i>], Tom Bertram in <i>Mansfield Park</i>
    [<i>MP</i>], and Mr. Elliot [<i>P</i>]).</p>

  <h4 id="questions">Questions left hanging: The Turn to FID <span class="back_to_top">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</span></h4>

  <p>Coding
  direct speech can tell us a lot about Austen&rsquo;s technique. However, much of
  the novels are rendered in indirect speech and free indirect discourse [FID]. In
  FID, the narrator renders not merely the point of view of a given character
  (focalization [link]) but gives the flavor of a character&rsquo;s speech or thought.
  In the most direct form of FID, the narrator ventriloquizes for the character; in
  other words, the reader senses that by changing third person pronouns to first person
  ones, one would have a rendering of the character&rsquo;s direct speech or thought.
  For instance, when Colonel Brandon first calls on Elinor and Marianne in London,
  Elinor&rsquo;s question to him in FID can readily be turned into direct dialogue:
  &ldquo;. . . she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him
  last&rdquo; becomes (inferentially) &ldquo;she asked,&ldquo; &lsquo;if you have been in
  London ever since I saw you last.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Outside of direct dialogue, free indirect discourse
  is the most common, economical, and sophisticated way novels (and other texts) relay
  information about thoughts and speech. &nbsp;For instance, early in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> we learn what Mr. Bingley
  thought of the Meryton assembly at which he meets the Bennet family:
  &ldquo;Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his
  life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality,
  no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he
  could not conceive an angel more beautiful&rdquo; (Ch. 4). The narrator is speaking,
  but the language is really Bingley&rsquo;s, including his use of clich&eacute;s and
  hyperbole (e.g., &ldquo;an angel more beautiful&rdquo;). One cannot account for
  diction in Austen&rsquo;s novels without paying attention to indirect speech,
  especially FID. Bingley needs to have credit for saying &ldquo;an angel more
  beautiful,&rdquo; not merely because it is his language but also because it is
  plainly <i>not</i> the language the
  narrator would choose for herself. Because FID always blends the speech of the
  narrator with that of a character, it creates opportunities for tremendous narrative
  flexibility, as narrators can vary how closely they mimic the language of their
  characters, and can make ironic points at the character&rsquo;s expense even as they
  seem to let their characters speak or think for themselves. FID&rsquo;s use in
  the eighteenth-century novel (British, German, French, etc.) was rudimentary&mdash;one
  finds some employment of FID in Goethe, for instance, and in Fanny Burney and Samuel
  Richardson, but no sustained or complex use. As many scholars have noted, it took
  Jane Austen, writing six novels between 1811 and 1817, to discover and exploit the full
  potential of FID, including FID&rsquo;s capacity to display complex ironies.
  Austen&rsquo;s discovery of what FID could do was comparable in the history of
  the novel to the discovery of the atomic bomb in the history of warfare; thereafter,
  things were never the same, and FID became a basic feature of the novel as
  genre.</p>

  <p class="c3 c12"><span>One cannot account for all the intricacies of
  Austen&rsquo;s use of diction by simply coding direct dialogue and leaving all the rest
  to the narrator, because the narrator is often speaking in the voice of her characters.
  &nbsp;Furthermore, without coding all forms of indirect speech, one cannot answer
  questions such as which character&rsquo;s diction most resembles that of the narrator,
  or even to which gender the narrator&rsquo;s diction aligns most closely. &nbsp;After
  all, within everything we had coded initially as &ldquo;narrator&rdquo; there were
  multitudinous points at which both the narrator and a given character are speaking at
  once (approximately 20%-30% of the narrator&rsquo;s language is FID). &nbsp;Accounting
  for all of the words in Austen&rsquo;s novels thus requires marking shared speech, both
  indirect speech and FID. &nbsp;Marking FID is a special challenge due to its nature.
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>Free indirect speech, free indirect discourse
  involves both a character's speech and the narrator's comments or presentation.
  Famously utilized by James Joyce, free indirect discourse is a more comprehensive
  method of representation--one which many times makes indistinguishable the thoughts of
  the narrator and the thoughts of a character. Thus, the method typically privileges the
  past tense, yet cannot be discerned through merely grammatical indicators.</span></p>

  "c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--International Society for
  the Study of Narrative (</span><span class=

<h4 id="focalization">Focalization <span class="back_to_top">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</span></h4>

  <p class="c3"><span class=
  "c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout, one of the greatest
  challenges for the coder of Austen&rsquo;s diction is distinguishing between
  focalization and FID. &nbsp;Focalization occurs when the narrator renders a
  character&rsquo;s point of view, feelings, motives, or thought. &nbsp;All FID is a kind
  of focalization, but not all focalization is FID. &nbsp;To be FID, the speech must have
  something of the flavor of the exact words the character would have used in either
  speech or thought; FID must be a kind of ventriloquism by the narrator.
  &nbsp;Focalizations which only convey a character&rsquo;s feelings are often not FID,
  as in this passage from</span> <span class="c0 c2">Emma</span><span>:
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Part of [Mrs. Weston&rsquo;s] meaning was to conceal some favourite
  thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston&rsquo;s on the subject, as much as possible.
  &nbsp;There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma&rsquo;s destiny, but it was not
  desirable to have them suspected&rdquo; (Ch. 5). &nbsp;These sentences speak to Mrs.
  Weston&rsquo;s motives, hoping to conceal from Emma that she wishes Emma would marry
  Frank Churchill, but she would not have said to herself something like &ldquo;part of
  my meaning is to conceal some favourite thoughts of my own.&rdquo; &nbsp;Similarly,
  when Emma leaps to insult Miss Bates, the narrator&rsquo;s comment, &ldquo;Emma could
  not resist,&rdquo; is focalization without FID. &nbsp;What is described is the flash of
  succumbing to temptation; the words in Emma&rsquo;s mind are presumably not &ldquo;I
  cannot resist&rdquo; but the clever and devastating thing she actually says to Miss
  Bates, &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! Ma&rsquo;am, there may be a difficulty. &nbsp;Pardon me, but
  you will be limited as to number, only three at once.&rsquo;&rdquo; &nbsp;The task of
  distinguishing between focalization and FID is made thornier when the narrator is
  describing the thoughts or speech of her wittier heroines, because it is sometimes
  difficult to discern between the narrator&rsquo;s ironies and those of her characters.
  &nbsp;Distinguishing FID for Catherine Morland (</span><span class=
  "c0 c2">NA</span><span>) was much easier, as Catherine&rsquo;s mind is no
  match for that of Austen&rsquo;s narrators. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <h4 id="scaling">Scaling <span class="back_to_top">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</span></h4>
  
  <p class="c3 c12"><span>Free indirect discourse wavers in its intensity.
  &nbsp;Sometimes it seems as if one could simply replace the third person pronouns with
  first person ones and one would have the character&rsquo;s direct speech, as in the
  earlier example of Elinor&rsquo;s question to Colonel Brandon. &nbsp;In other cases,
  the FID seems less fully direct ventriloquism of a character; instead the
  narrator&rsquo;s speech has something of the flavor of or, in some cases, only hints at
  a character&rsquo;s speech. &nbsp;To complicate the situation, the same passage of FID
  can change in intensity, as in this example, in which Elizabeth&rsquo;s thoughts about
  Darcy are rendered in FID, but the central statement, &ldquo;In that case he would
  return no more,&rdquo; seems most plainly rendered exactly as Elizabeth would have
  thought the idea (we show the coding here to show how we expressed the scaling of FID
  intensity): &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span>We found scaling to be the most difficult part of this
  project, for though FID clearly varies in intensity, ascribing it to a mathematical
  scale seems to offer a false scientific precision. &nbsp;We encourage readers to look
  at &ldquo;Novel Visualization&rdquo; [link] for a visual record of the scaling, where
  more intense colors represent more intense FID. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c12"><span>This section of the site allows the user to see

  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span>Almost half of Austen&rsquo;s FID is introduced by a
  kind of formula: &nbsp;&ldquo;character&rdquo; &ldquo;verb expressing thought or
  speech&rdquo; &ldquo;that&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that
  they might expect to see their father at home on the following day&rdquo;

  <p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  personography of Austen&rsquo;s novels would be very simple if we were limited only to
  speaking characters and the narrator. &nbsp;But once one turns one&rsquo;s attention to
  indirect speech and FID, the personography widens considerably. &nbsp;Sometimes living
  characters cite the dead; sometimes a group of people, such as Meryton society, render
  judgment through the narrator in FID; and sometimes characters speak in chorus in
  indirect speech. &nbsp;There are some occasions in which indirect speech is boxed
  within indirect speech within direct speech, and other complex configurations (for
  instance, when the narrator renders Elizabeth&rsquo;s thought in FID while
  incorporating within that FID the direct speech of Colonel Fitzwilliam). &nbsp;See
  Adventures in FID [link] for examples of complex indirect speech.</span></p>

  <h4 id="fid">Adventures in FID <span class="back_to_top">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</span></h4>
  
  <p class="c3 c12"><span>Here, courtesy of Carmen Smith, are some examples of
  the many complex forms of diction Austen employs relative to indirect diction and/or
  FID. &nbsp;The reader does not notice these complexities, generally, just as we do not
  pay much attention to occasions of indirect speech or even FID in our own
  lives&mdash;they seem natural, like water to a fish. &nbsp;However, coding for indirect
  speech forces philological precision, as much as it can be attained. &nbsp;Ultimately,
  this project depends on professional judgment about who speaks what and to what degree.
  &nbsp;As Roland Barthes noted in</span> <span class="c0 c2">S/Z</span><span class=
  "c0">,</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>Irony acts as a signpost, and thereby it destroys the
  multivalence that might be expected from quoted discourse. &nbsp;A multivalent text can
  carry out its basic duplicity only if it subverts the opposition between true and
  false, if it fails to attribute quotations (even seeking to discredit them) to explicit
  authorities, . . . in short, if it coldly and fraudulently abolishes quotation marks
  which . . . distribute the ownership of the sentences to their respective proprietors,
  like subdivisions of a field. &nbsp;(44-5)</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span>Austen&rsquo;s use of FID certainly &ldquo;abolished
  quotation marks&rdquo; which &ldquo;distribute the ownership of the sentences to their
  respective proprietors&rdquo;; we look to make judgments which put the marks back in,
  as it were, at least heuristically. &nbsp;We rely on informed inference throughout,
  especially in complex cases, a reliance which in turn depends on the interpretation of
  characters&rsquo; mindstates. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Direct dialogue within direct dialogue (here,
  changing the speaker from Mrs. Bennet to Mrs. Bennet-as-Mrs. Long, and then in the

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>&lsquo;And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in
  greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do
  you think she said besides? &ldquo;Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at

  told, that it was ten miles round. (Vol. III, Ch. 1)</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>&lsquo;My excellent father died about five years ago;
  and in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the
  best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
  valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant.&rsquo; (Vol. II, Ch.
  12)</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">FID by a large, unnamed collection of people, here,
  Meryton society:</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the
  luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run
  away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune. (Vol. III, Ch.
  13)</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Very short instance of FID inserted into narration,
  sometimes with a length of only one or two words (easy to miss!):</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear
  Wickham on every occasion&hellip; (Vol. III, Ch. 9)</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Direct quotation from another, in this scene
  physically absent, character within FID-thought (here,
  Elizabeth&rsquo;s)</span><span>:</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>&hellip;He had ruined for a while every hope of
  happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say
  how lasting an evil he might have inflicted. [par] &ldquo;There were some very strong
  objections against the lady,&rdquo; were Colonel Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s words, and these
  strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and
  another who was in business in London. (Vol. II, Ch. 10)</span></p>

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Word usage (&ldquo;said she&rdquo;) indicates direct
  dialogue, but contextually, this is clear FID (not said aloud as indicated by
  third-person usage) camouflaged as direct dialogue; in other words, the direct dialogue
  here constitutes FID:</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c4"><a name="h.gjdgxs" id="h.gjdgxs"></a><span class=
  "c0">&hellip;Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman,
  who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable. &ldquo;How could I ever think
  her like her nephew?&rdquo; said she, as she looked in her face. (Volume III, Chapter
  XIV)</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c22 c2">Some examples of typical introductions of FID in
  Austen:</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">&lsquo;That&rsquo; phrase indicating FID beforehand,
  sometimes also with &lsquo;that&rsquo; omitted but implied:</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might
  expect to see their father at home on the following day&hellip; (Volume III, Chapter
  VI)</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Entire sentence contextually leading into FID without
  direct cues:</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to
  put it out of her power, by running away. [par] But to live in ignorance on such a
  point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information&hellip;
  (Volume III, Chapter IX)</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she
  not seen him in Derbyshire&hellip; (Volume III, Chapter XI)</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Inserted phrase, generally synonymous with
  &ldquo;character thought&rdquo;:</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>Jane&rsquo;s delicate sense of honour would not allow
  her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
  it; &ndash; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she
  had rather be without a confidante. (Volume III, Chapter IX)</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Regular introduction of FID with &lsquo;that&rsquo;
  phrase, yet occurring within a letter by a different character, with a consequent
  change of speaker:</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>&lsquo;His own father did not long survive mine, and
  within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having
  finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for
  him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage&hellip;&rsquo; (Vol. II, Ch.
  12)</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Elaborate description introducing FID contained in
  prepositional clause; particularly difficult to ascertain where introduction ends and
  FID begins:</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3 c4"><span>The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty
  had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister&rsquo;s
  match&hellip; (Volume III, Chapter X)</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3"><span>[NOTE&mdash;Laura, here goes Carmen&rsquo;s
  &ldquo;Austen Project Modes of Speech Legend,&rdquo; which is a chart that sets the
  forms of speech against our coding of the same. Carmen has this and will send it to us.
  It has a note at the end that I am putting separately here in the text, on stuff not
  attributed to narrator or character, which thus</span> <span class="c0 c8">can be cut
  from the chart</span><span>]</span></p>

  

  <p class="c3"><span>[NOTE&mdash;Laura, here would be a good place to link
  Carmen&rsquo;s animated slideshow about how she did the actual coding]</span></p>

  <h4 id="text">Text <span class="back_to_top">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</span></h4>

  

  <p class="c12 c21 c25"><span>Austen&rsquo;s manuscripts, unlike (say) Walt
  Whitman&rsquo;s, are relatively unproblematic, with only a few genuine cruxes.
  &nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c17">The texts were created by comparing two previously
  digitized, open-source editions &mdash; one from The University of Adelaide, the other
  from Project Gutenberg. When differences occurred that were not obvious Optical
  Character Recognition errors, a third source, noted in the metadata for each text, was
  consulted.</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c12"><span>There are a few kinds of words or passages in the
  novels which are not coded as either character or narrator speech: &nbsp;chapter or
  volume markings (e.g., &ldquo;Volume II, Chapter I&rdquo;), quotations (e.g., from
  Shakespeare, Gray, or nursery rhymes), and putative documents (e.g., the passage on the
  Elliots in the Baronetage from</span> <span class="c0 c2">Persuasion</span><span class=
  "c0">&nbsp;or the newspaper clipping about Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s running off with
  Henry Crawford in</span> <span class="c0 c2">Mansfield Park</span><span>).
  &nbsp;Letters are treated throughout as direct speech from the letter-writer, though
  letters can and often do contain both indirect speech and free indirect speech (so
  coded). &nbsp;</span></p>

  

  <h4 id="forward">Going forward: &nbsp;FID in the novel <span class="back_to_top">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</span></h4>

  

  <p class="c3 c12"><span>If FID can be found computationally, the scholarly
  world would potentially be significantly advanced in terms of understanding narrative
  in general computationally.</span><span class="c0 c8">&nbsp;</span> <span class=
  "c0">That said, FID is notoriously hard to track. &nbsp;The scholarship on FID has
  confirmed what we suspected, that FID has no grammatical markers as such (see Further
  Reading [link]). &nbsp;However, having coded all of Austen&rsquo;s major novels for
  FID, we are in a position to test that and other propositions about FID in the novel,
  especially as Austen&rsquo;s innovations make her novels a linchpin of sorts in the
  history of FID and the history of the novel. &nbsp;We plan to deploy the encoded novels
  against the eighteenth-century novel (through the huge number of novels available
  digitally in ECCO, Eighteenth-Century Collections Online) and against the
  nineteenth-century novel (through the capacious hoard of Chadwick-Healey&rsquo;s
  Nineteenth-Century Fiction Collection). &nbsp;We expect that our work will have several
  important outputs and objectives: &nbsp;1) determining if FID can be found
  computationally in Austen; 2) determining if FID can be found computationally in novels
  more generally; and 3) providing the means to analyze the development of FID in the
  novel as genre. &nbsp;This last is the most ambitious of the three ambitious goals.
