              The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a

              he had brought only six with him from London — his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of
              only five altogether — Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.</span>

              his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in
              general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of
              a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his
              manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being
              pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being
              unworthy to be compared with his friend.</span>

              lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable
              qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss
              Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of
              his own party.</span>

              Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners,
              which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived,
              and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present

              humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather
              handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending
              more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly
              of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their

              county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of
              his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.</span>

              fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was
              tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour — was pleased with the
              situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.</span>

              character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater
              contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance,
              and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He
              was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had
              greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.</span>

              Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been
              formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his
              mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market
              town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
              where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,
              though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,
              friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.</span>

              disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of
              fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost
              every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely — a slight preference is natural
              enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a woman had better

              moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention.

              yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four

            <span id="said_no_00447" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives,
              and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient
              activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of
              exercise.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00448" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her
              appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself,
              was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received,
              however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. Mr.
              Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her
              complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00449" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and
              though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only
              been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her
              entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of
              gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00450" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them
              herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00462" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached
              acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing
              to do elsewhere.</span>

              Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her,
              that</span>

              His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she
              believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister
              scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who when
              he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.</span>

              When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her
              into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
              as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
              entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00799" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were
              instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself directly to Miss
              Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for
              Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the
              change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat down by
              her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight. </span>

            <span id="said_no_00800" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table — but in vain.
              She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00801" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She assured him that</span>
            <span id="said_no_00802" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msb" data-placement="auto top">no one intended to

            <span id="said_no_00803" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore
              nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,
              principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and
          she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
          question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second
          volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, <span id="said_no_00804" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“How pleasant it is to spend an evening
            in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my
            own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_00805" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the
              room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:</span>

            <span id="said_no_00806" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I
              would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to
              whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_00808" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried her brother, </span>

            <span id="said_no_00811" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she replied, </span>

              tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of

            <span id="said_no_00814" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her
              figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings,
              she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:</span>

            <span id="said_no_00815" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about
              the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.” </span>

          <span id="said_no_00816" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real
            object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and
            unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but </span>

                  "The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I
                  have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
                  lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.
                  —'There, Mrs. Bennet.'— My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so
                  fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty
                  and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful
                  respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a
                  clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
                  these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in
                  the entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be
                  otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of
                  my readiness to make them every possible amends,— but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house,
                  I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on
                  your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to
                  my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with
                  respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, </span>

              father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.
              The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted
              by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance
              had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his
              veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector,
              made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.</span>

              amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends — of atonement — for inheriting their father's estate;
              and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part. </span>

          <span id="said_no_01048" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an

            avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general

            <span id="said_no_01064" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him
              completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very
              pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation — a readiness at the same time perfectly
              correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice,
              and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them,
              and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.</span>

              Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at
              each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few
              moments, touched his hat — a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.</span>

              retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish
              for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was

              likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to
              have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth,
              and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told — the history of his acquaintance

              saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took
              their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01286" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs.
              Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr.
              Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of
              their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr.
              Darcy's look and behavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for
              though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them,
              and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even</span>
            <span id="said_no_01287" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mary could assure her family that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01288" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mary" data-placement="auto top">she had no disinclination

              is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider
              intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01290" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak
              unnecessarily to Mr. Collins,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01291" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could not help asking him</span>

            <span id="said_no_01293" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and
              was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance. </span>

            <span id="said_no_01295" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said he, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01296" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">“that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
              can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
              cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a
              preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01297" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham

            <span id="said_no_01298" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">to have Mr. Collins

            <span id="said_no_01299" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham's
              happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not
              the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01300" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It now first struck her, that</span>

              was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings,
              in the absence of more eligible visitors.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01302" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself,
              and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her
              charms, it was not long before</span>
            <span id="said_no_01303" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">her mother gave her to understand that</span>

            <span id="said_no_01305" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute

            <span id="said_no_01306" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Collins might never

              would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of
              rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after — the very shoe-roses for Netherfield
              were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her
              acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to
              Kitty and Lydia.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01308" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain
              for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting
              him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care,
              and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won
              in the course of the evening. But in an instant</span>
            <span id="said_no_01309" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">arose the dreadful suspicion of</span>

              assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against
              the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he
              directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of
              conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose
              blind partiality provoked her.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01319" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed
              for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she
              was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances,
              however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and
              often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The
              moment of her release from him was ecstacy. </span>

            <span id="said_no_01321" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">of talking</span>

              when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing
              what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried
              to console her:</span>

              for some time without speaking a word; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_01332" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she began to imagine that</span>

              judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the
              established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical
              office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom — provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time
              maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a
              point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case
              before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.”</span>
          
          <span id="said_no_01457" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly
            watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not
            hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.”
            It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him
            time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt
            seemed abundantly increasing with </span>
          <span id="said_no_01458" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved
            another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.</span>

              entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as
              happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt
              capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same
              way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most
              unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person
              (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating
              subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01468" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">His being such a charming
              young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01469" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">were the first points of self-gratulation;</span>

            <span id="said_no_01471" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">then it was such a comfort
              to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover,
              such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was
              so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into
              company more than she liked.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01472" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is
              the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01473" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She concluded with many good wishes that</span>

            <span id="said_no_01476" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to
              describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr.
              Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01479" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in
              the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr.
              Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his
              attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady
              gravity.</span>

              the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to
              revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing
              Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent
              such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began
              her song. Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an
              impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might
              be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
              her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
              talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
              imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary
              had finished her second song, said aloud, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01481" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other

            <span id="said_no_01482" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her,
              and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.</span>

              in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a
              clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other
              things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be
              beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his

              it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his
              preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards

              impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the

              allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at
              Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with
              considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite
              good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.</span>

              declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no
              feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances,
              which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast,
              he addressed the mother in these words:</span>

          <span id="said_no_01538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:</span>

            <span id="said_no_01539" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can

              also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant

              disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little
              unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my
              discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered
              the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be
              advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying — and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I
              certainly did.” </span>

              made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01546" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every
              clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very
              greatly to my happiness; and thirdly — which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
              of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this
              subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford — between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging
              Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01547" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">she said,</span>

              A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own,
              let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a
              woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'</span>
            <span id="said_no_01549" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
              and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I
              can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank
              will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards
              Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to
              inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without
              resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place
              — which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it
              will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.
              To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied
              with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be
              entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips
              when we are married.” </span>

              power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and
              may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally

              acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family
              of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in
              spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so
              small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not
              serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of
              elegant females.” </span>

              the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak
              plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.”

              all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her
              attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.</span>

              marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all — and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you — and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library,
              you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.
              Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for

            inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and

              not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that
              resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider
              me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid
              yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in
              having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through
              the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and
              if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.” </span>

              Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother.
              As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid
              her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible
              of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and

              in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least
              affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he stil meant to stay.</span>

              lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret
              and vexation, and the concern of everybody was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01657" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he voluntarily acknowledged that</span>

              all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the
              walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was
              most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.</span>

              envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's
              countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the
              letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off
              her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs.
              When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:</span>

              hear what she says.” </span>

              entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not
              leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
              frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's
              partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to favour

              she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to
              get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
              achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my
              dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
              degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him

              had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to
              escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to
              avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not
              willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had
              been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering
              kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.

              difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to

              might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections

              Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him
              herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, </span>

              know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that
              my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.” </span>

            stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea

              and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month
              passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive

              business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes

              successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the

              and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against
              it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
              whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
              my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or
              sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is

              prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for
              everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.” </span>

              must feel, as well as I do; that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte

              they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it — of which
              officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him,
              narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain
              enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the

              powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he
              belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five
              years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.</span>

              she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and
              inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her
              manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.</span>

                  judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though
                  the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as
                  natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
                  happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive
                  in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling
                  before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly
                  resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I
                  can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and
                  because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we
                  know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is
                  to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears
                  now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she
                  said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
                  cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of
                  duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy — your affection,
                  and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon.</span>

              material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been
              his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom
              he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for
              his wish of independence.</span>

              not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I
              am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though
              I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my
              comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.
              They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as

              diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
              Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and
              she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
              Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable
              sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and,
              in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled
              according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was
              added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be. </span>

              were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He

              Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she
              was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a
              troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness,
              as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the

              grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of
              dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's
              visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had,
              from her heart, given up the acquaintance. </span>

              and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection
              of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02094" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in
              it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the
              carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they
              were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was
              more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not
              altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his
              inquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and

            <span id="said_no_02102" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh

            <span id="said_no_02104" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">she could have so cheerful

            <span id="said_no_02105" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly
              was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely
              did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of
              their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out,
              and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the
              command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here,
              leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was
              pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees
              there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be
              compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a
              handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02106" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not
              having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend
              over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help. It was rather small, but well
              built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.
              When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02107" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth supposed</span>

              while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed: </span>

              will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my
              sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at
              Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should
              say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_02115" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had
              already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to
              understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to
              anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of
              their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02116" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden
              noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry,
              and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out— </span>

              who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his

              the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing
              altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</span>

              Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from
              any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and</span>
            <span id="said_no_02156" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">the mere stateliness of

              proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and
              Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband
              that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have
              thought necessary.</span>

              surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened
              almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could
              observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been
              handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not
              rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.
              Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02161" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she believed</span>

              resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin, and so
              small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain,
              were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who
              was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.</span>

              plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and
              looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was
              commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth
              wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially
              when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was
              an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh — the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the
              latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.</span>

              proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave
              her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and
              instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.</span>

              stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship
              said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory

              went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by
              the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and

              coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation

              loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other
              engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This, however, was no evil to
              Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the
              weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while
              the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path,
              which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.</span>

              and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard
              soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and</span>

              of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be
              amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady
              Catherine,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02252" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest

              within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage
              turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were

              announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty,
              not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire — paid
              his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of
              composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.</span>

            man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some

              the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
              received any invitation thither — for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
              almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
              come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at
              the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church.</span>

              Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could
              get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person
              in the room.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02276" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at
              Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent
              and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room
              before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while shared
              the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out: </span>

              myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her
              to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?” </span>

              practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no
              instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She

              Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to

            <span id="said_no_02375" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes,
              to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do,
              which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table,
              but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who
              lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning,
              sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came
              because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own
              satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02376" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">in comparing them, she saw</span>
            <span id="said_no_02377" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">there was less captivating
              softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02378" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she believed</span>
            <span id="said_no_02379" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he might have the best

            <span id="said_no_02380" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could
              not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of
              necessity rather than of choice — a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew
              not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own
              knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love
              her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to
              Hunsford; but without much success.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02381" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_char" data-placement="auto top">He certainly looked at her
              friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, stedfast gaze,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02382" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">but she often doubted</span>
            <span id="said_no_02383" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_char" data-placement="auto top">whether there were much

            <span id="said_no_02519" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.
              This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well;
              but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His

            <span id="said_no_02522" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his

            resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he

            <span id="said_no_02533" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of
              obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot — I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
              bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of
              short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
              it after this explanation.” </span>

            to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02535" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said, </span>

            <span id="said_no_02536" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might,

            <span id="said_no_02538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied she, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02539" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me
              that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided against you — had they been
              indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of
              ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?” </span>

              means of dividing them from each other — of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its
              derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.” </span>

              explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in his walk, and turning
              towards her, “these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long
              prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles,
              and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But
              disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in
              the inferiority of your connections? — to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my
              own?” </span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02568" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“From the very beginning — from the first moment, I may almost say — of
              my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
              feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had
              not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_02571" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from
              actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of
              it.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02572" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> That she should receive an

              of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case
              — was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride
              — his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane — his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not
              justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02573" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">soon overcame the pity</span>

              which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
              else; and, totally indisposed for employment,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02576" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she resolved,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02577" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> soon after breakfast, to

            <span id="said_no_02578" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
              sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike-road. The
              park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02579" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the
              pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great
              difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she
              caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she
              was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She
              had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by
              that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, “I have been walking
              in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a slight bow, turned again
              into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02580" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter,
              and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The
              envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning,
              and was as follows:— </span>
          
        </p>

                  containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
                  intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
                  effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be
                  written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it
                  unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.</span>
              
            </p>

                <span id="said_no_02582" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude,
                  you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your
                  sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and
                  blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my
                  father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be
                  a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.
                  But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future
                  secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I
                  am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. — The necessity must be
                  obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. "I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley
                  preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. — But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that
                  I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. — I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour
                  of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had
                  given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.</span>
                <span id="said_no_02583" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">He spoke of it</span>
                <span id="said_no_02584" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.#dar_sirl" data-placement="auto top"> as a certain event,
                  of which the time alone could be undecided.</span>
                <span id="said_no_02585" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive
                  that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,
                  cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though
                  she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not
                  been mistaken here, I must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.
                  If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to
                  assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however
                  amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain — but I
                  will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be
                  indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were
                  not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
                  connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
                  existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.
                  These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
                  total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
                  father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
                  representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like
                  censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will
                  only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have
                  led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
                  you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. "The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had
                  been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching
                  their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. — We accordingly went — and there I readily engaged in the
                  office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this
                  remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it
                  not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his
                  affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on
                  his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into
                  Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
                  is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures
                  of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even
                  yet ignorant of it. — That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probabe; but his regard did not appear to me enough
                  extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was
                  done for the best. — On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it
                  was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
                  them. "With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole
                  of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall
                  relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. "Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years
                  the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of
                  service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school,
                  and afterwards at Cambridge — most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
                  been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging;
                  he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is
                  many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities — the want of principle, which
                  he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with
                  himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain
                  — to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall
                  not prevent me from unfolding his real character — it adds even another motive. "My excellent father died about five years ago; and his
                  attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will </span>
                <span id="said_no_02586" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">he particularly recommended it to me,</span>
                <span id="said_no_02587" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.#dar_darsr" data-placement="auto top"> to promote his
                  advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow — and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be
                  his as soon as it became vacant.</span>
                <span id="said_no_02588" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top"> There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
                  survive mine, and within half a year from these events,</span>
                <span id="said_no_02589" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top"> Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, </span>
                <span id="said_no_02590" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.#dar_wick" data-placement="auto top"> having finally
                  resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu
                  of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.</span>
                <span id="said_no_02591" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top"> He had some intention, he added,</span>
                <span id="said_no_02592" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.#dar_wick" data-placement="auto top"> of studying the law,
                  and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.</span>
                <span id="said_no_02593" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top"> I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to
                  accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled — he resigned all
                  claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand
                  pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In
                  town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of
                  idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been
                  designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.</span>
                <span id="said_no_02594" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.#dar_wick" data-placement="auto top"> His
                  circumstances,</span>
                <span id="said_no_02595" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top"> he assured me,</span>
                <span id="said_no_02596" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top"> and I had no difficulty in believing it,</span>

                  bad.</span>
                <span id="said_no_02598" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.#dar_wick" data-placement="auto top"> He had found the law
                  a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question — of
                  which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten
                  my revered father's intentions.</span>
                <span id="said_no_02599" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top"> You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
                  resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances — and he was doubtless as
                  violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he
                  lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. "I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to
                  forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no
                  doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel
                  Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went
                  with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a
                  prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far
                  recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was
                  persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating
                  her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended
                  elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,
                  acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public
                  exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's
                  chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging
                  himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed. "This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in
                  which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
                  towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
                  wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
                  not in your inclination. "You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know
                  what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel
                  Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father's will, has been
                  unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility
                  of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only
                  add, God bless you.</span>

              happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next
              sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly
              resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He
              expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.</span>

              apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,</span>

              the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a
              considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation
              from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every
              particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself — from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's
              affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by
              the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished</span>

              his ways — seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust — anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;
              that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued — that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often
              heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been
              what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship

              shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of
              any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common
              flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her
              her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.” </span>

              may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that
              the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
              judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
              wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.” </span>

              good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their
              marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness
              were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of
              those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these
              tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to
              his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are
              wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.</span>

              to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing
              his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But</span>
            <span id="said_no_03043" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she had never felt so strongly as now</span>

            <span id="said_no_03047" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little other cause for
              satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose
              constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03048" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">though Kitty might in time
              regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be
              apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03049" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to
              which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was
              consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity — to have some other point on which her wishes and
              hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.
              Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the
              discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been
              perfect.</span>

              finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much

              period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they
              were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards
              than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03061" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly

              girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general
              favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way — teaching them, playing

              ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness
              wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream
              of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.

              a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy,</span>

              she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its

              for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms

            <span id="said_no_03269" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> Perhaps he had been civil

            <span id="said_no_03272" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> but he certainly had not

            <span id="said_no_03273" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and she
              felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03274" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher
              grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,
              with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03275" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish</span>
            <span id="said_no_03276" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrg" data-placement="auto top"> of going round the whole

            <span id="said_no_03279" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With a triumphant smile they were told that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03280" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_gar" data-placement="auto top"> it was ten miles

            <span id="said_no_03281" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after
              some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in
              character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a
              glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its
              windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go
              no farther, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03282" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and thought </span>
            <span id="said_no_03283" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsg" data-placement="auto top"> only of returning to the
              carriage as quickly as possible.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03284" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the
              opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was
              very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them,
              that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to
              what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being less sheltered than on the
              other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than
              before,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03285" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and resolved </span>
            <span id="said_no_03286" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> to appear and to speak
              with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03287" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">For a few moments, indeed,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03288" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she felt that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03289" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> he would probably strike

            <span id="said_no_03290" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he

            <span id="said_no_03291" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With a glance, she saw that</span>

            <span id="said_no_03294" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she began,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03295" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">as they met,</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03332" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on
            resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a
            little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support,
            and consequently preferred her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first
            spoke.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03333" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She wished him to know that</span>

              embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.
              Yet time and her aunt moved slowly — and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs.
              Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side

              her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her
              face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as

              Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but
              had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her
              again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever

              visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was
              most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager,
              and Darcy determined, to be pleased. </span>

          <span id="said_no_03438" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could fancy that</span>

          <span id="said_no_03446" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they

          <span id="said_no_03447" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of
            her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it
            “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply, he added, </span>

              his companions, as</span>
            <span id="said_no_03455" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">convinced her that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03456" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">the improvement of manners
              which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the
              acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace — when she saw
              him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03457" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage — the difference, the change
              was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03458" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">Never, even in the company
              of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence
              or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom
              his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.</span>

              readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt
              disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary
              embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she
              ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03465" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and
              on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
              satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
              uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03466" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force

            <span id="said_no_03467" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was evident that</span>

              acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03469" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03470" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance
              reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and
              his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it
              for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_03471" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">they soon became sensible that</span>

              servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03473" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially

            <span id="said_no_03476" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_lambsoc" data-placement="auto top">he was a liberal man,

            <span id="said_no_03477" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much
              estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his
              quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03478" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the
              evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and
              she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03479" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">She certainly did not hate
              him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so
              called.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03480" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly
              admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the
              testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above
              respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03481" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> gratitude, not merely for
              having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
              unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental
              meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two
              selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of
              so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude — for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on
              her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was
              grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and
              how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her
              renewal of his addresses.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03482" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that</span>

              civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought

              and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.</span>

              a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking
              woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and
              Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join
              in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.</span>

              Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and
              the other said no more.</span>

              Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party — for though they could not
              all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.</span>

              Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and</span>
            <span id="said_no_03525" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth saw that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03526" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> he was anxious for his

            <span id="said_no_03527" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity
              of saying, with sneering civility: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03528" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton? They

            <span id="said_no_03529" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but </span>
            <span id="said_no_03530" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth instantly comprehended that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03531" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> he was uppermost in her

            <span id="said_no_03532" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting
              herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an
              involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to
              lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but
              she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a
              sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of
              her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no creature had it been
              revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it,
              from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and
              without meaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively
              concern for the welfare of his friend.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03533" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed
              and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her
              brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn
              his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03534" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr.
              Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But
              Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such
              terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon,
              Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03542" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she rejoined, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03543" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her
              complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character — there is nothing marked in its lines. Her
              teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
              extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without
              fashion, which is intolerable.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03544" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of
              recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.
              He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued: </span>

              Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is

              conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within
              ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.</span>

              intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
              coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I
              know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at
              all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success — no such people had been seen to pass through. With the
              kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for
              him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I
              cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first

              their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of
              these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press
              for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help
              earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I
              have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means
              to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is
              obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will

              of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said
              in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might,
              perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early
              example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane's

              friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having
              settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a

              purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike
              them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.” </span>

              private? Oh! no, no — this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to
              marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia — what attraction has she
              beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
              restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing
              of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step
              forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was
              going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a
              matter.” </span>

              eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not
              doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a
              twelvemonth — she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and
              frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
              flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater
              — what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
              person and address that can captivate a woman.” </span>

              other circumstances which I am not at liberty — which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are
              endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary

              to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to
              make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should
              then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never

              corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two
              months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant
              and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”

            impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_03735" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me

            <span id="said_no_03738" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Yes; but, when questioned by him Denny denied knowing anything
              of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying — and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.” </span>

              uneasy — a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My
              father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing
              more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with
              each other, many weeks.” </span>

              post was expected. The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was

                  condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.
                  Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress,
                  which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that
                  can alleviate so severe a misfortune — or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a
                  parent's mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there
                  is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty
                  degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
                  disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are
                  grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I
                  have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the
                  others;</span>

                  me then advise you, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and

              they were to have a son. The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would
              by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after
              Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no
              turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.</span>

              what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least,
              which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment
              for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his
              willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03999" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrb" data-placement="auto top">He had never before supposed
              that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement.
              He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the
              continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within that sum.</span>

              surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had
              produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though
              dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but
              was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her. </span>

              neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss
              Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to
              be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in
              Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered certain.</span>

              her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter,
              which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran
              wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for
              a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
              importance.</span>

            <span id="said_no_04009" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrb" data-placement="auto top">her husband would not advance

            <span id="said_no_04010" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">He protested that</span>

            <span id="said_no_04012" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of
              inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could
              believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
              shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.</span>

              make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement,
              they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot. </span>

              secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have
              mortified her so much — not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself,</span>

              seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy
              would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man
              whom he so justly scorned.</span>

                <span id="said_no_04038" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
                  considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the
                  regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
                  ensigncy in General ——'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.
                  He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I
                  have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.
                  Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of
                  carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his
                  debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his
                  regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all
                  before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother. — Yours, etc.</span>

              sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so
              mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as
              they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she
              was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled,
              that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a
              scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.</span>

              and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so

              however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid
              man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my
              uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time,

                  my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am — and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed
                  him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. "On the very day of my coming home from
                  Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I

                  cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not
                  likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. "They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course
                  wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. "Every thing being settled between them, Mr.
                  Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr.
                  Gardiner could not be seen,</span>

                  with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle,
                  and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former.</span>
                <span id="said_no_04185" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top"> He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a
                  gentleman had called on business. "On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a
                  great deal of talk together. "They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as
                  soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect
                  of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. Nothing was
                  to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle
                  would most readily have settled the whole. "They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady
                  concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to
                  put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him
                  great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But,
                  Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most. "You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His
                  debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon
                    her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given
                  above.</span>
                <span id="said_no_04186" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.#mrsg_dar" data-placement="auto top"> It was owing to him,
                  to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
                  received and noticed as he was.</span>
                <span id="said_no_04187" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt
                  whether his reserve, or anybody's  reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all
                  this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for
                    another interest in the affair. "When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still
                  staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
                  receive the last finish. "I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope
                  at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He
                  was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was
                  exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious
                  manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,
                  it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and
                  for their sakes had patience with her. "Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with
                  us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this
                  opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as
                  pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly — he hardly ever
                  mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. "Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to
                  exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would
                  be the very thing. "But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour. Yours, very sincerely,</span>

              Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
              visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
              momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of
              walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip
              them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much
              afraid of him to talk;</span>

              have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was  right, but I
              was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son, (for
              many years an only child) I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father, particularly, all that was
              benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to
              think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.
              Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
              taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.

              affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane
              was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was
              deserved.</span>

              brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her
              sister.</span>

            <span id="said_no_05135" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so
              exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm
              was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must
              sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it,
              however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the
              country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was
              not till Sir William was out of sight.</span>

              Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet,
              whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make
              her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and
              to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from
              the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_05137" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she looked forward with delight to the time when</span>

              Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what
              delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family,
              that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a
              sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
              felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly. </span>

              mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The
              darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to
              every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.</span>

              In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed
              from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the
              further disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with
              her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.</span>

              of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize
              over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,</span>
            <span id="said_no_05144" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">it was suspected by her father that</span>

              sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had
              before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The
              congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a
              hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect: </span>

                  Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else
                  to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money
                  enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about

              unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His
              affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims

              retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as
              heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.</span>

              hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though
              at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always
              inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which
              had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a
              brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.</span>

              the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive,
              especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to
              overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either
              to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of
              that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the
              city.</span>

              the means of uniting them.</span>
