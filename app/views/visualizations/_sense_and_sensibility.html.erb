                    <span id="said_no_00001" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The family of Dashwood had
                        long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was
                        at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many
                        generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the
                        general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of
                        this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for
                        many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his
                        sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a
                        great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and
                        received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the
                        legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to
                        bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the
                        old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all
                        increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his
                        wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of
                        heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive;
                        and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence</span>
                </p>

                    <span id="said_no_00002" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">By a former marriage, Mr.
                        Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a
                        steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his
                        mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his
                        coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon
                        afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the succession to the
                        Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their
                        fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's
                        inheriting that property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and
                        their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the
                        remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child,
                        and he had only a life-interest in it.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00003" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The old gentleman died: his
                        will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment
                        as pleasure. He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his
                        estate from his nephew; — but he left it to him on such terms as
                        destroyed half the value of the bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more
                        for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son; —
                        but to his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old, it was
                        secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for
                        those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any
                        charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was
                        tied up for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his
                        father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his
                        uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or
                        three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his
                        own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all
                        the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received from his
                        niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark
                        of his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds
                        a-piece.</span>

                        disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and
                        sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living
                        economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate
                        already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. But the fortune,
                        which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth. He survived
                        his uncle no longer; and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies,
                        was all that remained for his widow and daughters.</span>

                        himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties. Had he
                        married a more amiable woman, he might have been made still more respectable
                        than he was:—he might even have been made amiable himself; for he was
                        very young when he married, and very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John
                        Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself; — more narrow-minded and

                        No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband's from the
                        moment of his father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so

                        there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any
                        offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of
                        immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of

                        say, was only such as might be reasonably expected of you; for instance,
                        such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them to
                        move their things, and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth,
                        whenever they are in season. I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther;
                        indeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but
                        consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your
                        mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand
                        pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which
                        brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will pay
                        their mother for their board out of it. Altogether, they will have five
                        hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more
                        than that? — They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be
                        nothing at all. They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any
                        servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any kind!
                        Only conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I
                        cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them
                        more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able to give
                        YOU something."</span>

                        fortune depended on the will of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike
                        uninfluenced by either consideration. It was enough for her that he appeared
                        to be amiable, that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the

                        pleasing. He was too diffident to do justice to himself; but when his
                        natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of an
                        open, affectionate heart. His understanding was good, and his education had
                        given it solid improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor
                        disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see
                        him distinguished — as — they hardly knew what. They wanted him
                        to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other. His mother

                        see him driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for great men or
                        barouches. All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of
                        private life. Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more

                        unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He did not disturb the wretchedness
                        of her mind by ill-timed conversation. She was first called to observe and
                        approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on
                        the difference between him and his sister. It was a contrast which

                            some surprise. Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet
                            — he is not the kind of young man — there is something
                            wanting — his figure is not striking; it has none of that grace
                            which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister.
                            His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once announce virtue
                            and intelligence. And besides all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no
                            real taste. Music seems scarcely to attract him, and though he admires
                            Elinor's drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person who
                            can understand their worth. It is evident, in spite of his frequent
                            attention to her while she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the
                            matter. He admires as a lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me,
                            those characters must be united. I could not be happy with a man whose
                            taste did not in every point coincide with my own. He must enter into
                            all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both. Oh!
                            mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last
                            night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much
                            composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my
                            seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven
                            me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful
                            indifference!" — </span>

                        to make Marianne's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her. She knew
                        that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment, they believed the

                            But farther than this you must not believe. I am by no means assured of
                            his regard for me. There are moments when the extent of it seems
                            doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at

                            or calling it more than it is. In my heart I feel little —
                            scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other points to be
                            considered besides his inclination. He is very far from being

                            occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never been
                            disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is
                            not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way, if
                            he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or

                        opinion to her sister. She could not consider her partiality for Edward in
                        so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it. There was, at times, a
                        want of spirits about him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of
                        something almost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to
                        feel it, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to
                        produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more
                        reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
                        indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither behaved to him
                        so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him any assurance
                        that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her
                        views for his aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as this, it was
                        impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She was far from
                        depending on that result of his preference of her, which her mother and
                        sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer they were together the
                        more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few
                        painful minutes, she believed it to be no more than friendship.</span>

                        be its limits, it was enough, when perceived by his sister, to make her

                        uncivil.</span>

                        a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of
                        her nearer connections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her
                        resolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county so
                        far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would
                        have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage
                        belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the
                        neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;
                        it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her
                        daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved place
                        would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its
                        mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his
                        kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both
                        letters to her daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation
                        before her answer were sent.</span>

                        would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland, than
                        immediately amongst their present acquaintance. On THAT head, therefore, it
                        was not for her to oppose her mother's intention of removing into
                        Devonshire. The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so simple a
                        scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of
                        objection on either point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which
                        brought any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of
                        Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from
                        sending a letter of acquiescence.</span>

                        effect on her in that point to which it principally tended. To separate
                        Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished

                        rendered impracticable. — The furniture was all sent around by water.
                        It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a
                        handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages
                        depart with a sigh: she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs.
                        Dashwood's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she
                        should have any handsome article of furniture.</span>

                        for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished, and she might have immediate
                        possession. No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she
                        waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her
                        future household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was
                        exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her, was
                        soon done. — The horses which were left her by her husband had been
                        sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of
                        her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her
                        eldest daughter. For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her
                        own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed.
                        HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three; two maids and
                        a man, with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had
                        formed their establishment at Norland.</span>

                        were sent off immediately into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their
                        mistress's arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs.
                        Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at
                        Barton Park; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the
                        house, as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as
                        her own. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution
                        by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her
                        removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under
                        a cold invitation to her to defer her departure. Now was the time when her
                        son-in-law's promise to his father might with particular propriety be
                        fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate,
                        their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for
                        its accomplishment. But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope
                        of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general drift of his discourse,
                        that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six
                        months at Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of
                        housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of
                        any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he
                        seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design
                        of giving money away.</span>

                        journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than
                        tedious and unpleasant. But as they drew towards the end of it, their
                        interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame
                        their dejection, and a view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them
                        cheerfulness. It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in
                        pasture. After winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own
                        house. A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat
                        wicket gate admitted them into it.</span>

                        though small, was comfortable and compact; but as a cottage it was
                        defective, for the building was regular, the roof was tiled, the window
                        shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered with
                        honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly through the house into the
                        garden behind. On each side of the entrance was a sitting room, about
                        sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs. Four
                        bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house. It had not been
                        built many years and was in good repair. In comparison of Norland, it was
                        poor and small indeed! — but the tears which recollection called forth
                        as they entered the house were soon dried away. They were cheered by the joy
                        of the servants on their arrival, and each for the sake of the others
                        resolved to appear happy. It was very early in September; the season was
                        fine, and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather,
                        they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in
                        recommending it to their lasting approbation.</span>

                        was good. High hills rose immediately behind, and at no great distance on
                        each side; some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.
                        The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a
                        pleasant view from the cottage windows. The prospect in front was more
                        extensive; it commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the
                        country beyond. The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley
                        in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched
                        out again between two of the steepest of them.</span>

                        yet to add and improve was a delight to her; and she had at this time ready

                        present be deficient. Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.
                        He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young
                        cousins to remember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and
                        his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their arrival
                        seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an object of
                        real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest desire of their living
                        in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially to
                        dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home, that,
                        though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond
                        civility, they could not give offence. His kindness was not confined to
                        words; for within an hour after he left them, a large basket full of garden
                        stuff and fruit arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of
                        the day by a present of game. He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their
                        letters to and from the post for them, and would not be denied the
                        satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day.</span>

                        Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty; her face was
                        handsome, her figure tall and striking, and her address graceful. Her
                        manners had all the elegance which her husband's wanted. But they would have
                        been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was
                        long enough to detract something from their first admiration, by shewing
                        that, though perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to
                        say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.</span>

                        wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise
                        precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine little boy about
                        six years old, by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to
                        by the ladies in case of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and
                        age, admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for
                        him, while he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise
                        of her ladyship,</span>

                        of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion

                        mile from the cottage. The ladies had passed near it in their way along the
                        valley, but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a
                        hill. The house was large and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style
                        of equal hospitality and elegance. The former was for Sir John's
                        gratification, the latter for that of his lady. They were scarcely ever
                        without some friends staying with them in the house, and they kept more
                        company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood. It was
                        necessary to the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and
                        outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of
                        talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with such as
                        society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a sportsman,
                        Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she humoured her children;
                        and these were their only resources. Lady Middleton had the advantage of
                        being able to spoil her children all the year round, while Sir John's
                        independent employments were in existence only half the time. Continual
                        engagements at home and abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of
                        nature and education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave
                        exercise to the good breeding of his wife.</span>

                        herself upon the elegance of her table, and of all her domestic

                        of their parties. But Sir John's satisfaction in society was much more real;
                        he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would
                        hold, and the noisier they were the better was he pleased. He was a blessing
                        to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever
                        forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his
                        private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering

                        in the country was always a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view
                        he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at
                        Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough
                        to secure his good opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl
                        could want to make her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness
                        of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation
                        might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In showing
                        kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good
                        heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all
                        the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only
                        those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of
                        encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own

                        the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman, he hoped the

                        Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished. Colonel
                        Brandon alone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures. He
                        paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on
                        the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless
                        want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that
                        ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was estimable
                        when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others; and she
                        was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have
                        outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment.
                        She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel's
                        advanced state of life which humanity required.</span>

                        was zealously active, as far as her ability reached; and missed no

                        acquaintance. She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and
                        had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a

                        Edward's farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me: it was the
                        good wishes of an affectionate brother to both. Twice did I leave them

                        invariable. When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to avoid

                        settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves. The house and the

                        the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland half its charms were
                        engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to
                        afford, since the loss of their father. Sir John Middleton, who called on
                        them every day for the first fortnight, and who was not in the habit of
                        seeing much occupation at home, could not conceal his amazement on finding

                        from Barton Park, were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent
                        entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated
                        assurances of his carriage being always at their service, the independence
                        of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children; and
                        she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a
                        walk. There were but few who could be so classed; and it was not all of them
                        that were attainable. About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the
                        narrow winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as
                        formerly described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks,
                        discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a
                        little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be
                        better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its possessor,
                        an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately too infirm to mix
                        with the world, and never stirred from home.</span>

                        abounded in beautiful walks. The high downs which invited them from almost

                        summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut
                        up their superior beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and
                        Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial
                        sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which
                        the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned. The weather was
                        not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book,

                        heads, and a driving rain set full in their face. — Chagrined and
                        surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly, to turn back, for no
                        shelter was nearer than their own house. One consolation however remained

                        hurried along, and reached the bottom in safety.</span>

                        ran to her assistance. She had raised herself from the ground, but her foot
                        had been twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. The
                        gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined
                        what her situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without
                        farther delay, and carried her down the hill. Then passing through the
                        garden, the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her
                        directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not

                        spirit from his exterior attractions. — Marianne herself had seen less
                        of his person than the rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her
                        face, on his lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him
                        after their entering the house. But she had seen enough of him to join in
                        all the admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned
                        her praise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn
                        for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the house
                        with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of thought which
                        particularly recommended the action to her. Every circumstance belonging to
                        him was interesting. His name was good, his residence was in their favourite
                        village, and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket
                        was the most becoming. Her imagination was busy, her reflections were
                        pleasant, and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.</span>

                        domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him. Of

                        complexion, regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure. Marianne was
                        still handsomer. Her form, though not so correct as her sister's, in having
                        the advantage of height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that
                        when in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth
                        was less violently outraged than usually happens. Her skin was very brown,
                        but, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her
                        features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in her eyes,
                        which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness, which could
                        hardily be seen without delight. From Willoughby their expression was at
                        first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his
                        assistance created. But when this passed away, when her spirits became
                        collected, when she saw that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman,
                        he united frankness and vivacity, and above all, when </span>

                    <span id="said_no_00366" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">she gave him such a look of

                        mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk. She could not be
                        silent when such points were introduced, and she had neither shyness nor
                        reserve in their discussion. They speedily discovered that their enjoyment
                        of dancing and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general conformity
                        of judgment in all that related to either. Encouraged by this to a further
                        examination of his opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of
                        books; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so
                        rapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been
                        insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of
                        such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was strikingly alike.
                        The same books, the same passages were idolized by each — or if any
                        difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than till the
                        force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed. He
                        acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm; and long before
                        his visit concluded, they conversed with the familiarity of a
                        long-established acquaintance.</span>

                            suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second
                            marriages, and then you can have nothing farther to ask."— </span>

                        wish of improving it could offer. He came to them every day. To enquire
                        after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the encouragement of his
                        reception, to which every day gave greater kindness, made such an excuse
                        unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect
                        recovery. She was confined for some days to the house; but never had any
                        confinement been less irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities,
                        quick imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was
                        exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined not
                        only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused
                        and increased by the example of her own, and which recommended him to her
                        affection beyond every thing else.</span>

                        peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on every
                        occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances. In hastily forming
                        and giving his opinion of other people, in sacrificing general politeness to
                        the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in
                        slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of
                        caution which Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne

                        his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his

                        attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the
                        raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose, was
                        removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly
                        annexed to sensibility. Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe
                        that the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own
                        satisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that however a
                        general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the
                        affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was
                        no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon. She saw it with

                        interest. His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve appeared
                        rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural
                        gloominess of temper. Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and
                        disappointments, which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,

                    <span id="said_no_00420" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Little had Mrs. Dashwood or
                        her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire, that so many
                        engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented
                        themselves, or that they should have such frequent invitations and such
                        constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment.
                        Yet such was the case. When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement
                        at home and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming, were put
                        into execution. The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the
                        water were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.
                        In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and
                        familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated
                        to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to
                        afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne, of
                        marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving, in her behaviour
                        to himself, the most pointed assurance of her affection.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00421" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elinor could not be
                        surprised at their attachment. She only wished that it were less openly
                        shewn; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some
                        self-command to Marianne. But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no
                        real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of
                        sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not
                        merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to
                        common-place and mistaken notions. Willoughby thought the same; and their
                        behaviour at all times, was an illustration of their opinions.</span>

                        no eyes for any one else. Every thing he did, was right. Every thing he
                        said, was clever. If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards,
                        he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand. If
                        dancing formed the amusement of the night, they were partners for half the
                        time; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to
                        stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made
                        them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame,
                        and seemed hardly to provoke them.</span>

                        all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking
                        this excessive display of them. To her it was but the natural consequence of
                        a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.</span>

                        happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond
                        attachment to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex, was more
                        likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before, by the charms
                        which his society bestowed on her present home.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00425" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elinor's happiness was not
                        so great. Her heart was not so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their
                        amusements so pure. They afforded her no companion that could make amends
                        for what she had left behind, nor that could teach her to think of Norland
                        with less regret than ever. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could
                        supply to her the conversation she missed; although the latter was an
                        everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness
                        which ensured her a large share of her discourse. She had already repeated
                        her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been
                        equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their
                        acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and what he
                        said to his wife a few minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was more
                        agreeable than her mother only in being more silent. Elinor needed little
                        observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with
                        which sense had nothing to do. Towards her husband and mother she was the
                        same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor
                        desired. She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day
                        before. Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the
                        same; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband,
                        provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children
                        attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than
                        she might have experienced in sitting at home; — and so little did her
                        presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their
                        conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst
                        them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.</span>

                        all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find a person who could in any degree
                        claim the respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship, or give
                        pleasure as a companion. Willoughby was out of the question. Her admiration
                        and regard, even her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;
                        his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might
                        have been more generally pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for
                        himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in
                        conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the
                        indifference of her sister.</span>

                        increased, as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love
                        had already been known to him. This suspicion was given by some words which
                        accidently dropped from him one evening at the park, when they were sitting
                        down together by mutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes
                        were fixed on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with
                        a faint smile,</span>

                            judged like her, but who from an inforced change — from a series

                        The lady would probably have passed without suspicion, had he not convinced
                        Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips. As it
                        was, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with
                        the tender recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more. But
                        Marianne, in her place, would not have done so little. The whole story would
                        have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing

                        Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it. He drove through
                        the park very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of

                        elder Miss Dashwoods. Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had
                        not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said

                        woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method
                        been informed that they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time

                        for we always know when we are acting wrong, and with such a conviction I

                        — There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice
                        comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would be
                        delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides. On one side
                        you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a beautiful hanging
                        wood, and on the other you have a view of the church and village, and,
                        beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired. I did
                        not see it to advantage, for nothing could be more forlorn than the
                        furniture, — but if it were newly fitted up — a couple of
                        hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the pleasantest

                            face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad. The estate at
                            Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year, and his
                            brother left everything sadly involved. I do think he must have been
                            sent for about money matters, for what else can it be? I wonder whether
                            it is so. I would give anything to know the truth of it. Perhaps it is
                            about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is, because he looked
                            so conscious when I mentioned her. May be she is ill in town; nothing in
                            the world more likely, for I have a notion she is always rather sickly.
                            I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams. It is not so very
                            likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW, for he is a
                            very prudent man, and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this
                            time. I wonder what it can be! May be his sister is worse at Avignon,
                            and has sent for him over. His setting off in such a hurry seems very
                            like it. Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart, and
                            a good wife into the bargain."</span>

                        Jennings. Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming
                        equally probable as they arose. Elinor, though she felt really interested in
                        the welfare of Colonel Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going
                        so suddenly away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for
                        besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting
                        amazement or variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.
                        It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby
                        on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them
                        all. As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange and
                        more incompatible with the disposition of both. Why they should not openly
                        acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each
                        other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine.</span>

                        that marriage might not be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby
                        was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich. His estate had
                        been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at
                        an expense to which that income could hardly be equal, and he had himself
                        often complained of his poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy
                        maintained by them relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed
                        nothing at all, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to
                        their general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind
                        of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her
                        making any inquiry of Marianne.</span>

                        expressive of attachment to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour. To
                        Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart
                        could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention
                        of a son and a brother. The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him
                        as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and
                        if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which
                        called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the
                        rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his
                        favourite pointer at her feet.</span>

                        and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the

                    <span id="said_no_00732" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Dashwood" data-placement="auto top">"Yes. I have explained it to
                        myself in the most satisfactory way; — but you, Elinor, who love to
                        doubt where you can — it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you shall
                        not talk ME out of my trust in it. I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects
                        his regard for Marianne, disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other
                        views for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away; — and
                        that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an
                        excuse to dismiss him. This is what I believe to have happened. He is,
                        moreover, aware that she DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not
                        therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he
                        feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her
                        schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell me, I
                        know, that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil,
                        unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as
                        satisfactory at this. And now, Elinor, what have you to say?"</span>

                        incomprehensible are your feelings! You had rather take evil upon credit
                        than good. You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt for
                        poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter. You are resolved to think
                        him blameable, because he took leave of us with less affection than his
                        usual behaviour has shewn. And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,
                        or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to
                        be accepted, merely because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to the
                        man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to
                        think ill of? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves,
                        though unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all, what is it you
                        suspect him of?"</span>

                        But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such
                        an alteration as we just witnessed in him. There is great truth, however, in
                        what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him,
                        and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may
                        undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope
                        that he has. But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them
                        at once. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at its
                        being practiced by him."</span>

                            return your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be explained
                            by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. He had just

                            plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his
                            honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general character;

                            illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself, or a

                        such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was
                        awake the whole night, and she wept the greatest part of it. She got up with
                        a headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;
                        giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all
                        attempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent
                        enough!</span>

                        walked out by herself, and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging

                        the equal indulgence of feeling. She played over every favourite song that

                        been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of
                        music that he had written out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no
                        farther sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day
                        applied. She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and
                        crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears. In books too, as
                        well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past
                        and present was certain of giving. She read nothing but what they had been
                        used to read together.</span>

                        after his leaving the country, Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters
                        in their usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself. Hitherto she had
                        carefully avoided every companion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to
                        walk on the downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked
                        of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be
                        found when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the
                        exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion. They
                        walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence, for
                        Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with gaining
                        one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the entrance of the valley,
                        where the country, though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long
                        stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to Barton, lay
                        before them; and on reaching that point, they stopped to look around them,
                        and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the
                        cottage, from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their
                        walks before.</span>

                        gentleman; and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,</span>

                        her. They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked
                        again; her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was
                        hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain
                        her; a third, almost as well known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging
                        her to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward

                        with great cordiality, but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of
                        regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself. To Marianne,
                        indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of
                        that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their
                        mutual behaviour. On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a
                        deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He
                        was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked
                        neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by
                        questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne saw
                        and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a dislike of
                        Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back
                        her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently
                        striking to those of his brother elect.</span>

                        whole, which had exceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured

                        shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to
                        particulars. I shall call hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces
                        strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged; and distant
                        objects out of sight, which ought only to be indistinct through the soft
                        medium of a hazy atmosphere. You must be satisfied with such admiration as I
                        can honestly give. I call it a very fine country — the hills are
                        steep, the woods seem full of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable
                        and snug — with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered
                        here and there. It exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it
                        unites beauty with utility — and I dare say it is a picturesque one
                        too, because you admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and
                        promontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me. I know
                        nothing of the picturesque."</span>

                        when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height. His spirits, during
                        the last two or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved
                        — he grew more and more partial to the house and environs —
                        never spoke of going away without a sigh — declared his time to be
                        wholly disengaged — even doubted to what place he should go when he
                        left them — but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so
                        quickly — he could hardly believe it to be gone. He said so
                        repeatedly; other things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings
                        and gave the lie to his actions.</span>

                        astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account; and it was happy
                        for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to
                        her, as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her
                        son. Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased
                        with his uncertain behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the
                        whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous
                        qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for
                        Willoughby's service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of openness, and
                        of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of independence,
                        and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs. The
                        shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them,
                        originated in the same fettered inclination, the same inevitable necessity
                        of temporizing with his mother. The old well-established grievance of duty
                        against will, parent against child, was the cause of all. She would have
                        been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was
                        to yield, — when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at
                        liberty to be happy. But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for
                        comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the
                        remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him
                        while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it which he

                            thought on this point, as you think now. It has been, and is, and
                            probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no
                            necessary business to engage me, no profession to give me employment, or
                            afford me any thing like independence. But unfortunately my own nicety,
                            and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless
                            being. We never could agree in our choice of a profession. I always
                            preferred the church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for
                            my family. They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart
                            for me. The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who
                            had chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first
                            circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no
                            inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which
                            my family approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I
                            was too old when the subject was first started to enter it — and,
                            at length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at
                            all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my
                            back as with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most
                            advantageous and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in

                            of his friends to do nothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have

                        front of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party
                        walking up to the door. Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and
                        Mrs. Jennings, but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were
                        quite unknown to her. She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir
                        John perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of
                        knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the
                        casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the door and
                        the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being
                        heard at the other.</span>

                        Cleveland the next day, and the two families at Barton were again left to
                        entertain each other. But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly got
                        their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done wondering at
                        Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, at Mr. Palmer's acting so
                        simply, with good abilities, and at the strange unsuitableness which often
                        existed between husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's
                        active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some other new

                        Exeter, they had met with two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the
                        satisfaction of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough for Sir
                        John to invite them directly to the park, as soon as their present
                        engagements at Exeter were over. Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave
                        way before such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little
                        alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to
                        receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of
                        whose elegance, — whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no
                        proof; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for
                        nothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much the worse; and
                        Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately
                        founded, when</span>

                        however, now to prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the
                        idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself
                        with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six
                        times every day.</span>

                        and in raptures with the furniture, and they happened to be so doatingly
                        fond of children that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their

                        prevail. He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within
                        a day or two, and then left them in amazement at their indifference, to walk
                        home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been
                        already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01268" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">When their promised visit to
                        the Park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place, they
                        found in the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very
                        plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was
                        not more than two or three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable
                        beauty; her features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a
                        smartness of air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace,
                        gave distinction to her person. — Their manners were particularly
                        civil, and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she
                        saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves
                        agreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual
                        raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their
                        whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate
                        demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of
                        whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing, or
                        in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance the
                        day before had thrown them into unceasing delight. Fortunately for those who
                        pay their court through such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of
                        praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the
                        most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing;
                        and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her
                        offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest
                        surprise or distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent
                        encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted. She saw
                        their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their work-bags
                        searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of
                        its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no other surprise than that
                        Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by, without claiming a share in
                        what was passing.</span>

                        bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly
                        scratching the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness such
                        violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly
                        noisy. The mother's consternation was excessive; but it could not surpass
                        the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three, in so
                        critical an emergency, which affection could suggest as likely to assuage
                        the agonies of the little sufferer. She was seated in her mother's lap,
                        covered with kisses, her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the
                        Miss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with
                        sugar plums by the other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was
                        too wise to cease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her
                        two brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were
                        ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of
                        similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully
                        applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this
                        unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady
                        on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.
                        — She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother's arms, in
                        quest of this medicine, and as the two boys chose to follow, though
                        earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies
                        were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours.</span>

                        general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her on
                        serious reflection to suspect it in the present case, where no temptation
                        could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a
                        description. What Lucy had asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not,
                        dared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every side by such
                        probabilities and proofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes.
                        Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation
                        for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near
                        Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own
                        prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge
                        of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had
                        often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed altogether
                        such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,
                        and established as a fact, which no partiality could set aside, his
                        ill-treatment of herself. — Her resentment of such behaviour, her
                        indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time made her feel only for
                        herself; but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.</span>

                        whatever it might once have been, she could not believe it such at present.
                        His affection was all her own. She could not be deceived in that. Her
                        mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her at
                        Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. He certainly loved

                        if rationally spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must have
                        opened his eyes to her defects of education, while the same period of time,
                        spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits, had
                        perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an

                        engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in
                        fortune to herself. These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated
                        from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was
                        the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and

                        occurred to her in painful succession, she wept for him, more than for
                        herself. Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her
                        present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing
                        to forfeit her esteem, she thought she could even now, under the first smart
                        of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the
                        truth from her mother and sisters. And so well was she able to answer her
                        own expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after
                        she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would
                        have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning
                        in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of
                        her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a
                        man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she
                        expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.</span>

                        Elinor's distress. On the contrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the
                        communication of what would give such affliction to them, and to be saved
                        likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow
                        from the excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more

                        from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an
                        earnest wish of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one. She wanted
                        to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more
                        clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were
                        any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him, and she
                        particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the
                        matter again, and her calmness in conversing on it, that she was no
                        otherwise interested in it than as a friend, which she very much feared her
                        involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least
                        doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very
                        probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,
                        not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to trust her on so
                        short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so confessedly and evidently
                        important. And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had some
                        weight. But indeed, while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of
                        being really beloved by Edward, it required no other consideration of
                        probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she
                        was so, her very confidence was a proof.</span>

                        the disclosure of the affair could there be, but that Elinor might be
                        informed by it of Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid
                        him in future?</span>

                        understanding thus much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly

                        combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible;
                        she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that
                        her heart was unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to
                        hear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own
                        ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.</span>

                        that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well
                        disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred; for the weather
                        was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they
                        might most easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met
                        at least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at
                        the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.
                        Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton's head;
                        and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat, and
                        none at all for particular discourse. They met for the sake of eating,
                        drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards, or consequences, or any
                        other game that was sufficiently noisy.</span>

                        Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had
                        threatened her. The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had
                        expected; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression, and nothing
                        could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the
                        dining parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied
                        them, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the

                        otherwise, her exertions would be of a different nature —</span>

                        to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which might
                        lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01675" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">They were three days on
                        their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they travelled was a happy
                        specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings
                        might be expected to be. She sat in silence almost all the way, wrapt in her
                        own meditations, and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking, except when any
                        object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation
                        of delight exclusively addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct
                        therefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which
                        she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs.
                        Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever
                        she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible
                        kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and
                        only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the
                        inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod, or boiled
                        fowls to veal cutlets. They reached town by three o'clock the third day,
                        glad to be released, after such a journey, from the confinement of a
                        carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.</span>

                        handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies were immediately put in
                        possession of a very comfortable apartment. It had formerly been
                        Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured
                        silks of her performance, in proof of her having spent seven years at a
                        great school in town to some effect.</span>

                        ready in less than two hours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ
                        the interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for that purpose. In a

                        it could be no more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed
                        with eager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the

                        She could scarcely eat any dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the
                        drawing room, seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every
                        carriage.</span>

                        to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much engaged in her own room, could
                        see little of what was passing. The tea things were brought in, and already
                        had Marianne been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring
                        door, when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one
                        at any other house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's
                        approach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was
                        silent; this could not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced
                        a few steps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned
                        into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him
                        would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she
                        could not help exclaiming,</span>

                        be borne with calmness, and she immediately left the room. Elinor was
                        disappointed too; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon
                        ensured his welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so
                        partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief
                        and disappointment in seeing him. She instantly saw that it was not
                        unnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room,
                        with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the recollection of
                        what civility demanded towards herself.</span>

                        would allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their names announced from
                        one landing-place to another in an audible voice, and entered a room
                        splendidly lit up, quite full of company, and insufferably hot. When they
                        had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house,
                        they were permitted to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat
                        and inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some
                        time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to
                        Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and Elinor
                        luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great distance from

                        woman. She soon caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without
                        attempting to speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but
                        see her; and then continued his discourse with the same lady. Elinor turned
                        involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by her. At
                        that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with
                        sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly, had not her
                        sister caught hold of her.</span>

                        himself rather to Elinor than Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and
                        determined not to observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after

                        the middle of a rubber, on being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too
                        polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away, and making over her
                        cards to a friend, they departed as soon the carriage could be found.
                        Scarcely a word was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne
                        was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs.
                        Jennings was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own
                        room, where hartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon
                        undressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her sister
                        then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure
                        enough for thinking over the past.</span>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01953" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Willoughby" data-placement="auto top">"I have just had the honour
                        of receiving your letter, for which I beg to return my sincere
                        acknowledgments. I am much concerned to find there was anything in my
                        behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation; and though I am
                        quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to
                        offend you, I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been
                        perfectly unintentional. I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance
                        with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure, and
                        flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my
                        actions. My esteem for your whole family is very sincere; but if I have been
                        so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt, or meant to
                        express, I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my
                        professions of that esteem. That I should ever have meant more you will
                        allow to be impossible, when you understand that my affections have been
                        long engaged elsewhere, and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before
                        this engagement is fulfilled. It is with great regret that I obey your
                        commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you,
                        and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed on me.</span>

                        confirm their separation for ever, she was not aware that such language

                        letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing with his
                        desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no breach of
                        faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever — a letter of which
                        every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in
                        hardened villainy.</span>

                        time with indignant astonishment; then read it again and again; but every
                        perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man, and so bitter
                        were her feelings against him, that she dared not trust herself to speak,
                        lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement,
                        not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst
                        and most irremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an
                        unprincipled man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most
                        important.</span>

                        on the contents of the letter, on the depravity of that mind which could
                        dictate it, and probably, on the very different mind of a very different
                        person, who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her
                        heart gave him with every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate
                        distress of her sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet
                        unread, and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when
                        on hearing a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see
                        who could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to
                        perceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been ordered till
                        one. Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of contributing, at
                        present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs.
                        Jennings, on account of her sister being indisposed. Mrs. Jennings, with a
                        thoroughly good-humoured concern for its cause, admitted the excuse most
                        readily, and Elinor, after seeing her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom
                        she found attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reached just in time
                        to prevent her from falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want
                        of proper rest and food; for it was many days since she had any appetite,
                        and many nights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no
                        longer supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was
                        felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness.
                        A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly, made her more
                        comfortable, and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness,
                        by saying,</span>

                        naturally produced, with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton
                        appeared to me to justify. I was repulsed indeed! I have passed a wretched

                        apology for your behaviour, I am perfectly ready to hear your justification
                        of it. You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely deceived, in
                        something concerning me, which may have lowered me in your opinion. Tell me
                        what it is, explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall be
                        satisfied, in being able to satisfy you. It would grieve me indeed to be
                        obliged to think ill of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that you
                        are not what we have hitherto believed you, that your regard for us all was
                        insincere, that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let it be

                        to what I now suffer. If your sentiments are no longer what they were, you
                        will return my notes, and the lock of my hair which is in your

                        true. He is to be married very soon — a good-for-nothing fellow! I
                        have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago, and
                        she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure
                        I should not have believed it; and I was almost ready to sink as it was.
                        Well, said I, all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used a young
                        lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife
                        may plague his heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend
                        on it. I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever I meet
                        him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a
                        day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only
                        young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face you will
                        never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won't disturb her any longer, for
                        she had better have her cry out at once and have done with. The Parrys and
                        Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse

                        sometimes almost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments, and returned
                        her those civilities, which her sister could not make or return for herself.
                        Their good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing
                        was due to her which might make her at all less so. She treated her
                        therefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite
                        child on the last day of its holidays. Marianne was to have the best place
                        by the fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to
                        be amused by the relation of all the news of the day. Had not Elinor, in the
                        sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she could have
                        been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in
                        love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire. As soon,
                        however, as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition
                        on Marianne, she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of Misery,
                        and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got up and hurried
                        out of the room.</span>

                        notion of it, I would not have joked her about it for all my money. But then
                        you know, how should I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing
                        but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at
                        about them. Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they
                        hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street
                        in my way home, and told them of it. But I shall see them tomorrow."</span>

                        a stone's throw. To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park,
                        where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a
                        neighbour nearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as

                        uncertainty, the partiality of tender recollection, there is a very strong
                        resemblance between them, as well in mind as person. The same warmth of
                        heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my
                        nearest relations, an orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of
                        my father. Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we
                        were playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love
                        Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps,
                        judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me
                        incapable of having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the
                        attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a
                        different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me for
                        ever. She was married — married against her inclination to my brother.
                        Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered. And this, I
                        fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who was at once her
                        uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love
                        her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any
                        difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the misery of her
                        situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame all her
                        resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing — but how
                        blindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We were
                        within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the
                        folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a
                        relation far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no
                        amusement, till my father's point was gained. I had depended on her
                        fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one — but had her
                        marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have
                        reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it. This
                        however was not the case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures
                        were not what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her
                        unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so
                        inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. She resigned herself
                        at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it been if she
                        had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me
                        occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke
                        inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father
                        lived only a few months after their marriage, and I was with my regiment in
                        the East Indies) she should fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps —
                        but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years,
                        and for that purpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage
                        had given me," he continued, in a voice of great agitation, "was of trifling
                        weight — was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years
                        afterwards, of her divorce. It was THAT which threw this gloom, — even
                        now the recollection of what I suffered — "</span>

                        rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room. Elinor, affected by
                        his relation, and still more by his distress, could not speak. He saw her
                        concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with
                        grateful respect. A few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to
                        proceed with composure.</span>

                        after this unhappy period before I returned to England. My first care, when
                        I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her; but the search was as fruitless
                        as it was melancholy. I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and
                        there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink
                        deeper in a life of sin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her
                        fortune, nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from
                        my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months
                        before to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it, that
                        her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to dispose of it
                        for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I had been six months
                        in England, I DID find her. Regard for a former servant of my own, who had
                        since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit him in a spunging-house,
                        where he was confined for debt; and there, in the same house, under a
                        similar confinement, was my unfortunate sister. So altered — so faded
                        — worn down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I believe
                        the melancholy and sickly figure before me, to be the remains of the lovely,
                        blooming, healthful girl, on whom I had once doted. What I endured in so
                        beholding her — but I have no right to wound your feelings by
                        attempting to describe it — I have pained you too much already. That
                        she was, to all appearance, in the last stage of a consumption, was —
                        yes, in such a situation it was my greatest comfort. Life could do nothing
                        for her, beyond giving time for a better preparation for death; and that was
                        given. I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper
                        attendants; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life: I was
                        with her in her last moments."</span>

                            have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. Their fates,
                            their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet
                            disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier
                            marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other
                            be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been distressing you
                            for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood — a subject such as this —
                            untouched for fourteen years — it is dangerous to handle it at
                            all! I WILL be more collected — more concise. She left to my care
                            her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first guilty
                            connection, who was then about three years old. She loved the child, and
                            had always kept it with her. It was a valued, a precious trust to me;
                            and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by
                            watching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations
                            allowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was
                            therefore placed at school. I saw her there whenever I could, and after
                            the death of my brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which
                            left to me the possession of the family property,) she visited me at
                            Delaford. I called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I
                            have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. It
                            is now three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that
                            I removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very
                            respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four
                            or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I
                            had every reason to be pleased with her situation. But last February,
                            almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her,
                            (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go
                            to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father
                            there for his health. I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I
                            thought well of his daughter — better than she deserved, for, with
                            a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would
                            give no clue, though she certainly knew all. He, her father, a
                            well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give
                            no information; for he had been generally confined to the house, while
                            the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they
                            chose; and</span>

                            received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell; and
                            this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly, which I am sure
                            must at the time have appeared strange to every body, and which I
                            believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I
                            suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the
                            party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor
                            and miserable; but HAD he known it, what would it have availed? Would he
                            have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister? No, he
                            had already done that, which no man who CAN feel for another would do.
                            He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced, in a
                            situation of the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help, no
                            friends, ignorant of his address! He had left her, promising to return;
                            he neither returned, nor wrote, nor relieved her."</span>

                        you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than both. Knowing all this, as I have
                        now known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister
                        as fond of him as ever, and on being assured that she was to marry him:
                        guess what I must have felt for all your sakes. When I came to you last week
                        and found you alone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute
                        what to do when it WAS known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you
                        then; but now you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so deceived;
                        to see your sister — but what could I do? I had no hope of interfering
                        with success; and sometimes I thought your sister's influence might yet
                        reclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what were
                        his designs on her. Whatever they may have been, however, she may now, and
                        hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when
                        she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched
                        and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with
                        an affection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a mind
                        tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life. Surely this
                        comparison must have its use with her. She will feel her own sufferings to
                        be nothing. They proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. On
                        the contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them.
                        Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it, must
                        strengthen every attachment. Use your own discretion, however, in
                        communicating to her what I have told you. You must know best what will be
                        its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed it might be
                        of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered myself to
                        trouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital which
                        may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of
                        others."</span>

                        were, the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to
                        see. Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for
                        she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made
                        neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and
                        seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But though
                        this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried
                        home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it, in her

                        even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of compassionate respect, and though
                        she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before, she did not see
                        her less wretched. Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a
                        gloomy dejection. She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more
                        heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart;</span>

                        sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent

                        indignation even greater than Elinor's. Long letters from her, quickly

                        wait. All that could be done was, to sit down at that end of the counter
                        which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was

                        Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong, natural, sterling
                        insignificance, though adorned in the first style of fashion.</span>

                        soon after their acquaintance began, invited them to dine in Harley Street,
                        where they had taken a very good house for three months. Their sisters and
                        Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure
                        Colonel Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were,
                        received his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.
                        They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons
                        were to be of the party. The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough
                        to make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet
                        Edward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to
                        attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect
                        indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in company
                        with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as

                        considerable. John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth

                        which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's

                        to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a temporary alteration in the

                        her young friends; for as she wished to be as much as possible with
                        Charlotte, she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed, and
                        did not return till late in the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the
                        particular request of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day in
                        Conduit Street. For their own comfort they would much rather have remained,
                        at least all the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing
                        to be urged against the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made
                        over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in
                        fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_02582" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">They had too much sense to
                        be desirable companions to the former; and by the latter they were
                        considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR ground, and sharing the
                        kindness which they wanted to monopolize. Though nothing could be more
                        polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not
                        really like them at all. Because they neither flattered herself nor her
                        children, she could not believe them good-natured; and because they were
                        fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing
                        what it was to be satirical; but THAT did not signify. It was censure in
                        common use, and easily given.</span>

                        restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked the idleness of one, and the
                        business of the other. Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before
                        them, and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at
                        other times, she feared they would despise her for offering. Miss Steele was
                        the least discomposed of the three, by their presence; and it was in their
                        power to reconcile her to it entirely. Would either of them only have given
                        her a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr.
                        Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice
                        of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.
                        But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out
                        expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a
                        reflection on</span>

                        Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor! But so little were
                        they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her, that if Sir John

                        of a misfortune, which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so
                        happened that while her two sisters with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on
                        her in Harley Street, another of her acquaintance had dropt in — a
                        circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her. But
                        while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong

                        happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the

                        Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she
                        immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this
                        misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of invitation
                        for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small musical party
                        at her house. The consequence of which was, that Mrs. John Dashwood was

                        cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples. So I looked at it directly,
                        and, 'Lord! my dear,' says I, 'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum
                        — ' and nurse said just the same. But Charlotte, she would not be

                        in from Harley Street, so he stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he
                        saw the child, he said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but
                        the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away
                        again, it came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think
                        of it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon
                        that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know
                        something or other, and at last he said in a whisper,</span>

                        you have believed such a thing possible? — There is no great wonder in
                        their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward
                        between them, and nobody suspect it! — THAT is strange! — I
                        never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out
                        directly. Well, and so this was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs.

                        think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride. She fell into violent
                        hysterics immediately, with such screams as reached your brother's ears, as
                        he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing
                        a letter to his steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a
                        terrible scene took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little
                        dreaming what was going on. Poor soul! I pity HER. And I must say, I think
                        she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon
                        drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried
                        bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not
                        know what to do.</span>

                        wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion! — and Mr. Donavan
                        thinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and the
                        best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be
                        within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as
                        ever my cousins left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in
                        hysterics too; and so she may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of
                        them. I have no notion of people's making such a to-do about money and
                        greatness. There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not
                        marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and
                        though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how
                        to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only
                        allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it
                        as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in such
                        another cottage as yours — or a little bigger — with two maids,
                        and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty
                        has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly."</span>

                        and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts, she was able to
                        give such an answer, and make such observations, as the subject might
                        naturally be supposed to produce. Happy to find that she was not suspected
                        of any extraordinary interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late
                        often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to
                        Edward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt
                        very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her
                        judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one
                        concerned in it.</span>

                        than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do,
                        though there could not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;
                        and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself. For HIM she
                        felt much compassion; — for Lucy very little — and it cost her
                        some pains to procure that little; — for the rest of the party none at

                        practicable to Marianne. Her narration was clear and simple; and though it
                        could not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent
                        agitation, nor impetuous grief. — THAT belonged rather to the hearer,
                        for Marianne listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be
                        the comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and
                        all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of
                        mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of

                        constant attachment, and all that can be said of one's happiness depending
                        entirely on any particular person, it is not meant — it is not fit

                        Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her
                        sex; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought

                        Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty
                        to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make you and my
                        mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you, yet unable to prepare
                        you for it in the least. — It was told me, — it was in a manner
                        forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all
                        my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph. — This person's
                        suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear
                        indifferent where I have been most deeply interested; — and it has not
                        been only once; — I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to
                        again and again. — I have known myself to be divided from Edward for
                        ever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the
                        connection. — Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything
                        declared him indifferent to me. — I have had to contend against the
                        unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered
                        the punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages. —
                        And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has
                        not been my only unhappiness. — If you can think me capable of ever
                        feeling — surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW. The
                        composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider
                        the matter, the consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the
                        effect of constant and painful exertion; — they did not spring up of
                        themselves; — they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.

                        my dearest friends — from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy."

                        for him, was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly
                        engaged to another person! — such a suspicion could never have entered
                        her head! If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in
                        THAT quarter.</span>

                        in her praise of Edward's conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood
                        its true merit. THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be
                        disobedient, and how small was the consolation, beyond the consciousness of
                        doing right, that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.
                        Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in
                        compassion for his punishment. But though confidence between them was, by
                        this public discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on
                        which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided it
                        upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too
                        warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued
                        affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and Marianne's
                        courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic which always
                        left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison it
                        necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.</span>

                        that comparison; but not as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion
                        now; she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach, regretted
                        most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before; but it brought only
                        the torture of penitence, without the hope of amendment. Her mind was so
                        much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible, and
                        therefore it only dispirited her more.</span>

                        already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that
                        knowledge farther, without seeking after more, she had resolved from the

                        could; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual, had

                        March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number; but Marianne, who knew
                        that the Willoughbys were again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting
                        them, chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public a

                        Jennings's conversation, she was herself left to quiet reflection. She saw
                        nothing of the Willoughbys, nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of
                        anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her.
                        But at last she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele,
                        who, though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting
                        them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs.
                        Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's. Mrs.
                        Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,</span>

                        began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment,

                        observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even
                        changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by the

                        seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation, and was too
                        intent on what he said to pursue her employment. — Still farther in
                        confirmation of her hopes, in the interval of Marianne's turning from one
                        lesson to another, some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear,

                            fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income.

                        since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street, and as since that time no
                        notice had been taken by them of his wife's indisposition, beyond one verbal
                        enquiry, Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit. — This
                        was an obligation, however, which not only opposed her own inclination, but
                        which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions.
                        Marianne, not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very
                        urgent to prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her
                        carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs. John
                        Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late
                        discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward's part,
                        could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again. The consequence
                        was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit, for which no one could
                        really have less inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete with a
                        woman, whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike.</span>

                        had been just going to call in Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny

                        staying in this house, I happened to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw
                        quite enough of her. The merest awkward country girl, without style, or
                        elegance, and almost without beauty. — I remember her perfectly. Just
                        the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward. I offered
                        immediately, as soon as my mother related the affair to me, to talk to him
                        myself, and dissuade him from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found,
                        to do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew
                        nothing of it till after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me,
                        you know, to interfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier
                        — I think it is most probable — that something might have been
                        hit on. I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong
                        light. 'My dear fellow,' I should have said, 'consider what you are doing.
                        You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family
                        are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot help thinking, in short, that means
                        might have been found. But now it is all too late. He must be starved, you
                        know; — that is certain; absolutely starved."</span>

                        to his wife and her mother; she found him very capable of being a pleasant
                        companion, and only prevented from being so always, by too great an aptitude
                        to fancy himself as much superior to people in general, as he must feel
                        himself to be to Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte. For the rest of his character
                        and habits, they were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no
                        traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his
                        eating, uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to
                        slight it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have
                        been devoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the whole, much
                        better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she could
                        like him no more; — not sorry to be driven by the observation of his
                        Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency on the
                        remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple taste, and diffident
                        feelings.</span>

                        some of his concerns, she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon,
                        who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who, treating her at once as the
                        disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself,
                        talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its
                        deficiencies, and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing
                        them. — His behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other
                        particular, his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten
                        days, his readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion,
                        might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment, and
                        would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the first,
                        believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it herself. But as
                        it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head, except by Mrs.
                        Jennings's suggestion; and she could not help believing herself the nicest
                        observer of the two; — she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings
                        thought only of his behaviour; — and while his looks of anxious
                        solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head and throat, the beginning of a
                        heavy cold, because unexpressed by words, entirely escaped the latter lady's
                        observation; — SHE could discover in them the quick feelings, and
                        needless alarm of a lover.</span>

                        mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend's, in making
                        very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland; and almost

                        auspiciously as it began. — Towards the evening Marianne became ill
                        again, growing more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before. Her
                        sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to attribute the change to
                        nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made; and
                        carefully administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction,
                        sink at last into a slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial
                        effects. Her sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a
                        considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she
                        resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings, knowing
                        nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her maid,
                        who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in the
                        housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne.</span>

                        frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips, was
                        almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber, when Marianne,
                        suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house, started hastily up,
                        and, with feverish wildness, cried out, —</span>

                        her mother. To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting
                        the latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its
                        performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her
                        sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he was

                        he listened to them in silent despondence; — but her difficulties were
                        instantly obviated, for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion,
                        and the service pre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the
                        messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood. Elinor made no resistance that was
                        not easily overcome. She thanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude,

                        exactness the time in which she might look for his return. Not a moment was
                        lost in delay of any kind. The horses arrived, even before they were
                        expected, and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of
                        solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the
                        carriage. It was then about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's
                        apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the
                        rest of the night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both. Hour

                        and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings
                        to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress had

                        though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his
                        patient, he would not allow the danger to be material, and talked of the
                        relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence
                        which, in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor. He promised to call
                        again in the course of three or four hours, and left both the patient and

                        hear in the morning of what had passed. Her former apprehensions, now with
                        greater reason restored, left her no doubt of the event; and though trying
                        to speak comfort to Elinor, her conviction of her sister's danger would not
                        allow her to offer the comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The

                        compassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her
                        companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly
                        injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too, particularly a

                        his second visit; — but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of
                        what the last would produce. His medicines had failed; — the fever was
                        unabated; and Marianne only more quiet — not more herself —
                        remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching all, and more than all, his
                        fears in a moment, proposed to call in further advice. But he judged it
                        unnecessary: he had still something more to try, some more fresh
                        application, of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his visit
                        concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear, but could not
                        enter the heart of Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of
                        her mother; but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued
                        till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering
                        from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits
                        oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who scrupled
                        not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of
                        previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment had brought on.
                        Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it gave fresh misery to
                        her reflections.</span>

                        began — but with a caution — a dread of disappointment which for
                        some time kept her silent, even to her friend — to fancy, to hope she
                        could perceive a slight amendment in her sister's pulse; — she waited,
                        watched, and examined it again and again; — and at last, with an
                        agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness, than all her
                        foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though
                        forced, on examination, to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep
                        her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance; — and
                        Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not
                        to hope. But it was too late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its
                        anxious flutter, she bent over her sister to watch — she hardly knew
                        for what. Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed
                        her. Others even arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all
                        flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her
                        with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in
                        equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of
                        Mr. Harris at four o'clock; — when his assurances, his felicitations
                        on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation, gave her
                        confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.</span>

                        cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led to any thing rather than
                        to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her doting
                        mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort,
                        and expand it in fervent gratitude; — but it led to no outward
                        demonstrations of joy, no words, no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was
                        satisfaction, silent and strong.</span>

                        succour, and watching almost every look and every breath. The possibility of
                        a relapse would of course, in some moments, occur to remind her of what
                        anxiety was — but when she saw, on her frequent and minute

                        Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room
                        to tea. Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of dinner by their
                        sudden reverse, from eating much; — and the present refreshment,
                        therefore, with such feelings of content as she brought to it, was
                        particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its
                        conclusion, to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to
                        take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no
                        capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was not to be kept
                        away from her sister an unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore
                        attending her up stairs into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all
                        continued right, left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and
                        retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.</span>

                        stormy. The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the
                        windows; but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not. Marianne slept
                        through every blast; and the travellers — they had a rich reward in
                        store, for every present inconvenience.</span>

                        it been ten, Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard
                        a carriage driving up to the house; and so strong was the persuasion that
                        she DID, in spite of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,
                        that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window
                        shutter, to be satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had
                        not deceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.
                        By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by
                        four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor mother's alarm,
                        gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.</span>

                        found it so difficult to be calm, as at that moment. The knowledge of what
                        her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door — of her
                        doubt — her dread — perhaps her despair! — and of what SHE
                        had to tell! — with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm. All
                        that remained to be done was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till
                        she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister, she hurried down
                        stairs.</span>

                        and saw only Willoughby.</span>

                            thing. When I first became intimate in your family, I had no other

                            feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging, I
                            endeavoured, by every means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her,

                            large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of
                            associating with people of better income than myself. Every year since
                            my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and
                            though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet
                            that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for
                            some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a
                            woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not a
                            thing to be thought of; — and with a meanness, selfishness,
                            cruelty — which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,
                            Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much — I was acting in this
                            manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it.
                            — But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of
                            selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated,
                            because I did not THEN know what it was to love. But have I ever known
                            it? — Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I
                            have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice? — or, what is
                            more, could I have sacrificed hers? — But I have done it. To avoid
                            a comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have
                            deprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,
                            lost every thing that could make it a blessing."</span>

                            affection which I had already taken such pains to display. But in the

                            that I have nothing to urge — that because she was injured she was
                            irreproachable, and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint. If
                            the violence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding —
                            I do not mean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved
                            better treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the
                            tenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any
                            return. I wish — I heartily wish it had never been. But I have
                            injured more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for
                            me — (may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose
                            mind — Oh! how infinitely superior!"—</span>

                        offence at once, and my confusion may be guessed. The purity of her life,
                        the formality of her notions, her ignorance of the world — every thing
                        was against me. The matter itself I could not deny, and vain was every
                        endeavour to soften it. She was previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the
                        morality of my conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with the
                        very little attention, the very little portion of my time that I had
                        bestowed on her, in my present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach.
                        By one measure I might have saved myself. In the height of her morality,
                        good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That
                        could not be — and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her
                        house. The night following this affair — I was to go the next morning
                        — was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be.
                        The struggle was great — but it ended too soon. My affection for
                        Marianne, my thorough conviction of her attachment to me — it was all
                        insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those
                        false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to
                        feel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to believe myself
                        secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself
                        to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. A heavy
                        scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire; — I was
                        engaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore
                        necessary for my breaking this engagement. But whether I should write this
                        apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate. To see
                        Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see
                        her again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however, I undervalued
                        my own magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw
                        her miserable, and left her miserable — and left her hoping never to
                        see her again."</span>

                        really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself — and I resolved therefore

                        took from me the power of dissembling. Her sorrow, her disappointment, her
                        deep regret, when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so

                        assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days, that in spite
                        of the many, many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant in her
                        own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever,
                        awakened all my remorse. I say awakened, because time and London, business
                        and dissipation, had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a
                        fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to
                        fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of
                        our past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my
                        shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach, overcoming
                        every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, 'I shall be heartily glad to
                        hear she is well married.' — But this note made me know myself better.
                        I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the
                        world, and that I was using her infamously. But every thing was then just
                        settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat was impossible. All that I had
                        to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no answer to Marianne, intending by
                        that to preserve myself from her farther notice; and for some time I was
                        even determined not to call in Berkeley Street; — but at last, judging
                        it wiser to affect the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything
                        else, I watched you all safely out of the house one morning, and left my
                        name."</span>

                    <span id="said_no_03366" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Willoughby" data-placement="auto top">"Even so. You would be
                        surprised to hear how often I watched you, how often I was on the point of
                        falling in with you. I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight, as the
                        carriage drove by. Lodging as I did in Bond Street, there was hardly a day
                        in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but
                        the most constant watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing
                        desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us so long. I avoided
                        the Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely
                        to prove an acquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in town,
                        however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming,
                        and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings's. He asked me to a party, a
                        dance at his house in the evening. — Had he NOT told me as an
                        inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have felt it
                        too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The next morning brought
                        another short note from Marianne — still affectionate, open, artless,
                        confiding — everything that could make MY conduct most hateful. I
                        could not answer it. I tried — but could not frame a sentence. But I
                        thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day. If you CAN pity me, Miss
                        Dashwood, pity my situation as it was THEN. With my head and heart full of
                        your sister, I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman! —
                        Those three or four weeks were worse than all. Well, at last, as I need not
                        tell you, you were forced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut! — what
                        an evening of agony it was! — Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one
                        side, calling me Willoughby in such a tone! — Oh, God! — holding
                        out her hand to me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching eyes
                        fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face! — and Sophia, jealous as
                        the devil on the other hand, looking all that was — Well, it does not
                        signify; it is over now. — Such an evening! — I ran away from
                        you all as soon as I could; but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face
                        as white as death. — THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;
                        — the last manner in which she appeared to me. It was a horrid sight!
                        — yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of
                        comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those,
                        who saw her last in this world. She was before me, constantly before me, as
                        I travelled, in the same look and hue."</span>

                        You saw what she said. I was breakfasting at the Ellisons, — and her
                        letter, with some others, was brought to me there from my lodgings. It
                        happened to catch Sophia's eye before it caught mine — and its size,
                        the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her
                        a suspicion. Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to
                        some young lady in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation
                        the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more
                        jealous than ever. Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is
                        delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read
                        its contents. She was well paid for her impudence. She read what made her
                        wretched. Her wretchedness I could have borne, but her passion — her
                        malice — At all events it must be appeased. And, in short — what
                        do you think of my wife's style of letter-writing? — delicate —
                        tender — truly feminine — was it not?"</span>

                        diction. But what could I do! — we were engaged, every thing in
                        preparation, the day almost fixed — But I am talking like a fool.
                        Preparation! — day! — In honest words, her money was necessary
                        to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a
                        rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my character in the opinion
                        of Marianne and her friends, in what language my answer was couched? —
                        It must have been only to one end. My business was to declare myself a
                        scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little
                        importance. — 'I am ruined for ever in their opinion — ' said I
                        to myself — 'I am shut out for ever from their society, they already
                        think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will only make them think me a
                        blackguard one.' Such were my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate
                        carelessness, I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics of
                        Marianne. Her three notes — unluckily they were all in my pocketbook,
                        or I should have denied their existence, and hoarded them for ever — I
                        was forced to put them up, and could not even kiss them. And the lock of
                        hair — that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book,
                        which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,
                        — the dear lock — all, every memento was torn from me."</span>

                        her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss
                        of the moment. He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her

                        recovered herself, to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes
                        she was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever by absence,
                        unhappiness, and danger. Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the
                        meeting, was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of
                        farther sleep; — but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even
                        prudent, when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in
                        knowing her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for
                        conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every
                        nurse around her. Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor,
                        in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed. But the rest, which
                        one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most wearing anxiety
                        seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.

                        something much more pleasing in his countenance. — There was always a
                        something, — if you remember, — in Willoughby's eyes at times,
                        which I did not like."</span>

                        companion, and each found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness

                        saw, as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying,
                        she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender
                        than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole of
                        her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to
                        reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common
                        sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of
                        resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight
                        of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.
                        — She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness, and
                        though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without the
                        atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went
                        to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera, procured
                        for her by Willoughby, containing some of their favourite duets, and bearing
                        on its outward leaf her own name in his hand-writing. —</span>

                            from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and
                            reading. I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course
                            of serious study. Our own library is too well known to me, to be
                            resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement. But there are many
                            works well worth reading at the Park; and there are others of more
                            modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon. By
                            reading only six hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a
                            twelve-month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to
                            want."</span>

                        what I know your judgment must censure. My illness has made me think —
                        It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection. Long before I
                        was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly able to reflect. I considered
                        the past: I saw in my own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance
                        with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and
                        want of kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my
                        sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to
                        the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself
                        by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be
                        wrong. Had I died, — it would have been self-destruction. I did not
                        know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these
                        reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery, — wonder that the very
                        eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God, and to
                        you all, did not kill me at once. Had I died, — in what peculiar
                        misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister! — You,
                        who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known
                        all the murmurings of my heart! — How should I have lived in YOUR
                        remembrance! — My mother too! How could you have consoled her! —
                        I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I looked towards the
                        past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged. Every body seemed
                        injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had
                        repaid with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the
                        Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust;
                        with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their
                        very attention. — To John, to Fanny, — yes, even to them, little
                        as they deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, — you above
                        all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart
                        and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me? — not to any
                        compassion that could benefit you or myself. — Your example was before
                        me; but to what avail? — Was I more considerate of you and your
                        comfort? Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by
                        taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular
                        gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone? — No;
                        — not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you
                        at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely
                        allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only that heart
                        which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an
                        unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake."</span>

                        lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for Willoughby

                            yourself. But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been
                            happy? — The inconveniences would have been different. He would
                            then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they
                            are removed, he now reckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of
                            whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always
                            necessitous — always poor; and probably would soon have learned to
                            rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of
                            far more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of

                        received, need not be particularly told. This only need be said; —
                        that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock, about three hours
                        after his arrival, he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent,
                        and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover, but, in the
                        reality of reason and truth, one of the happiest of men. His situation
                        indeed was more than commonly joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph
                        of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released
                        without any reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed
                        his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love; — and
                        elevated at once to that security with another, which he must have thought
                        of almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire.
                        He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to happiness;
                        — and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine, flowing,
                        grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in him

                            ignorance of the world — and want of employment. Had my brother
                            given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the
                            care of Mr. Pratt, I think — nay, I am sure, it would never have
                            happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the time,
                            a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had any
                            pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her
                            for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied
                            attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I
                            must have done. But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having
                            any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself, I
                            returned home to be completely idle; and for the first twelvemonth
                            afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which belonging to the
                            university would have given me; for I was not entered at Oxford till I
                            was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy
                            myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect
                            comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my brother, and
                            disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to be very often
                            at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure
                            of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there
                            from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and
                            obliging. She was pretty too — at least I thought so THEN; and I
                            had seen so little of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and
                            see no defects. Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as
                            our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it
                            was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of
                            folly."</span>

                        turns but tranquil. But when the second moment had passed, when she found
                        every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared her situation with what so
                        lately it had been, — saw him honourably released from his former
                        engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the release, to address herself
                        and declare an affection as tender, as constant as she had ever supposed it
                        to be, — she was oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity;
                        — and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized
                        with any change for the better, it required several hours to give sedateness
                        to her spirits, or any degree of tranquillity to her heart.</span>

                        their happiness certain — and they only wanted something to live upon.
                        Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living,

                        Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer, and Colonel
                        Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park; from

                        such flattery, he did revive. No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached
                        him: — he knew nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his
                        visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was
                        explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice in
                        what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest

                        principal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful
                        humility, assiduous attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the
                        smallest opening was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to
                        his choice, and re-established him completely in her favour.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_03825" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The whole of Lucy's
                        behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may
                        be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest, an
                        unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress may be apparently
                        obstructed, will do in securing every advantage of fortune, with no other
                        sacrifice than that of time and conscience. When Robert first sought her
                        acquaintance, and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only
                        with the view imputed to him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her
                        to give up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the
                        affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would
                        settle the matter. In that point, however, and that only, he erred; —
                        for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in
                        TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to produce this
                        conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted, which
                        could only be removed by another half hour's discourse with himself. His
                        attendance was by this means secured, and the rest followed in course.
                        Instead of talking of Edward, they came gradually to talk only of Robert,
                        — a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other, and
                        in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short,
                        it became speedily evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his
                        brother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very
                        proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. What immediately
                        followed is known. They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish;
                        for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut — and he drew
                        several plans for magnificent cottages; — and from thence returning to
                        town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of
                        asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted. The forgiveness, at
                        first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who
                        had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none,
                        still remained some weeks longer unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of
                        conduct and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and
                        gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the
                        haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon
                        afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and
                        influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or
                        Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once
                        intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and
                        birth, was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and
                        always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child. They settled in town,
                        received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms
                        imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and ill-will
                        continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of
                        course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between
                        Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they
                        all lived together.</span>

                        forfeit the right of eldest son, might have puzzled many people to find out;
                        and what Robert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them still
                        more. It was an arrangement, however, justified in its effects, if not in
                        its cause; for nothing ever appeared in Robert's style of living or of
                        talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as
                        either leaving his brother too little, or bringing himself too much; —
                        and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in
                        every particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,
                        and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no
                        less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an
                        exchange.</span>

                        her as little from her family as could well be contrived, without rendering
                        the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother and sisters spent
                        much more than half their time with her. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives
                        of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford;
                        for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly
                        less earnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It
                        was now her darling object. Precious as was the company of her daughter to
                        her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her
                        valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was equally
                        the wish of Edward and Elinor. They each felt his sorrows, and their own
                        obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward of
                        all.</span>

                        voluntarily to give her hand to another! — and THAT other, a man who
                        had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment,

                        with her mother, and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study, as
                        afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,

                        with a woman of character, as the source of her clemency, gave him reason
                        for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at
                        once have been happy and rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus
                        brought its own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted; — nor
                        that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with
                        regret. But that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or
                        contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not
                        be depended on — for he did neither. He lived to exert, and frequently
                        to enjoy himself. His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home always
                        uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs, and in sporting of every
