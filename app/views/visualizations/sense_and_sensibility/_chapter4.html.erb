                            the performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means
                            deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of
                            improving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would
                            have drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so
                            much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture;
                            but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general
                            direct him perfectly right."</span>

                        was very far from that rapturous delight, which, in her opinion, could alone
                        be called taste. Yet, though smiling within herself at the mistake, she
                        honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced
                        it.</span>

                            in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved
                            conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his principles can
                            be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent. You
                            know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth. But of his minuter
                            propensities, as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been
                            kept more ignorant than myself. He and I have been at times thrown a
                            good deal together, while you have been wholly engrossed on the most
                            affectionate principle by my mother. I have seen a great deal of him,
                            have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of
                            literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I venture to pronounce that
                            his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his
                            imagination lively, his observation just and correct, and his taste
                            delicate and pure. His abilities in every respect improve as much upon
                            acquaintance as his manners and person. At first sight, his address is
                            certainly not striking; and his person can hardly be called handsome,
                            till the expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good, and the
                            general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived. At present, I know
                            him so well, that I think him really handsome; or at least, almost so.
                            What say you, Marianne?"?</span>

                        believed the regard to be mutual; but she required greater certainty of it
                        to make Marianne's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her. She knew

                            them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion â€” the
                            hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.
                            But farther than this you must not believe. I am by no means assured of
                            his regard for me. There are moments when the extent of it seems
                            doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at
                            my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by believing
                            or calling it more than it is. In my heart I feel little â€”
                            scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other points to be
                            considered besides his inclination. He is very far from being
                            independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's
                            occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never been
                            disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is
                            not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way, if
                            he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or
                            high rank."</span>

                        opinion to her sister. She could not consider her partiality for Edward in
                        so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it. There was, at times, a
                        want of spirits about him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of
                        something almost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to
                        feel it, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to
                        produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more
                        reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
                        indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither behaved to him
                        so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him any assurance
                        that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her
                        views for his aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as this, it was
                        impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She was far from
                        depending on that result of his preference of her, which her mother and
                        sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer they were together the
                        more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few
                        painful minutes, she believed it to be no more than friendship.</span>

                        and property in Devonshire. The letter was from this gentleman himself, and

                    <span id="said_no_00178" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">He seemed really anxious to
                        accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a
                        style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at
                        a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of
                        her nearer connections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her
                        resolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county so
                        far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would
                        have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage
                        belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the
                        neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;
                        it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her
                        daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved place
                        would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its
                        mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his
                        kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both
                        letters to her daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation
                        before her answer were sent.</span>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00179" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elinor had always thought it
                        would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland, than
                        immediately amongst their present acquaintance. On THAT head, therefore, it
                        was not for her to oppose her mother's intention of removing into
                        Devonshire. The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so simple a
                        scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of
                        objection on either point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which
                        brought any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of
                        Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from
                        sending a letter of acquiescence.</span>
