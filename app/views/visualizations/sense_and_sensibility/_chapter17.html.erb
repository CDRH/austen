                        only for a moment at seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her
                        opinion, of all things the most natural. Her joy and expression of regard
                        long outlived her wonder. He received the kindest welcome from her; and
                        shyness, coldness, reserve could not stand against such a reception. They
                        had begun to fail him before he entered the house, and they were quite
                        overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not
                        very well be in love with either of her daughters, without extending the
                        passion to her; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become
                        more like himself. His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and
                        his interest in their welfare again became perceptible. He was not in
                        spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was
                        attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits. The whole family
                        perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality
                        in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all selfish
                        parents.</span>
