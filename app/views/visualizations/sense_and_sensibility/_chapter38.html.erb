                    <span id="said_no_02813" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Jennings was very warm
                        in her praise of Edward's conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood
                        its true merit. THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be
                        disobedient, and how small was the consolation, beyond the consciousness of
                        doing right, that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.
                        Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in
                        compassion for his punishment. But though confidence between them was, by
                        this public discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on
                        which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided it
                        upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too
                        warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued
                        affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and Marianne's
                        courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic which always
                        left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison it
                        necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02814" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">She felt all the force of
                        that comparison; but not as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion
                        now; she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach, regretted
                        most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before; but it brought only
                        the torture of penitence, without the hope of amendment. Her mind was so
                        much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible, and
                        therefore it only dispirited her more.</span>

                        them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs in Harley Street, or
                        Bartlett's Buildings. But though so much of the matter was known to them
                        already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that
                        knowledge farther, without seeking after more, she had resolved from the
                        first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she
                        could; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual, had
                        prevented her going to them within that time.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02816" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The third day succeeding
                        their knowledge of the particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to
                        draw many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second week in
                        March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number; but Marianne, who knew
                        that the Willoughbys were again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting
                        them, chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public a
                        place.</span>

                        Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor
                        was not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging all Mrs.
                        Jennings's conversation, she was herself left to quiet reflection. She saw
                        nothing of the Willoughbys, nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of
                        anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her.
                        But at last she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele,
                        who, though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting
                        them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs.
                        Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's. Mrs.
                        Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,</span>

                        dear. She will tell you any thing if you ask. You see I cannot leave Mrs.

                        Mrs. Jennings's curiosity and Elinor's too, that she would tell any thing
                        WITHOUT being asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.</span>

                        so. My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare sometimes I do not know

                        Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once Lucy thought to
                        write to him, but then her spirits rose against that. However this morning
                        he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came out, how he
                        had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been talked to by his
                        mother and all of them, and how</span>

                        other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on
                        purpose to get the better of it. And after thinking it all over and over

                        to keep her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss, for he
                        had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if
                        he was to go into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but
                        a curacy, and how was they to live upon that?</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02855" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Nancy Steele" data-placement="auto top">I heard him say all this as

                        take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing
                        to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not
                        give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a great

                        kindness, and my cousins would be proud to know her. — My paper
                        reminds me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully
                        remembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and the dear
                        children, when you chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,</span>

                        go and see her, sure enough. How attentive she is, to think of every body!
                        — Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me. It is as pretty a letter as
                        ever I saw, and does Lucy's head and heart great credit."</span>
