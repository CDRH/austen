                        weakening in its kind, had not been long enough to make her recovery slow;
                        and with youth, natural strength, and her mother's presence in aid, it
                        proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove, within four days after the
                        arrival of the latter, into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room. When there, at her
                        own particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to
                        him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit
                        her.</span>

                        room, in seeing her altered looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she

                        something more than his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its
                        being known to others;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03487" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she soon discovered in
                        his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister, the
                        probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back
                        by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now
                        strengthened by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining
                        weakness, and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.</span>

                        influenced, and therefore watching to very different effect, saw nothing in
                        the Colonel's behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self-evident
                        sensations, while in the actions and words of Marianne</span>

                        gratitude already dawned.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_03491" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">At the end of another day or
                        two, Marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood,
                        urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes, began to talk of
                        removing to Barton. On HER measures depended those of her two friends; Mrs.
                        Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel
                        Brandon was soon brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode
                        there as equally determinate, if not equally indispensable. At his and Mrs.
                        Jennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to
                        accept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better
                        accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint invitation of
                        Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-nature made her friendly
                        and hospitable for other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure to
                        redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course of a few weeks.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_03492" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The day of separation and
                        departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened a
                        leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full of respect and
                        kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of
                        past inattention, and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of
                        a friend, was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he
                        seemed anxious that she should engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and
                        Elinor then followed, and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the
                        travellers, and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to
                        her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two
                        young companions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his
                        solitary way to Delaford.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_03493" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Dashwoods were two days
                        on the road, and Marianne bore her journey on both, without essential
                        fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most solicitous
                        care could do to render her comfortable, was the office of each watchful
                        companion, and each found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness
                        of spirits. To Elinor, the observation of the latter was particularly
                        grateful.</span>

                        week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of heart which she had
                        neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to conceal,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03496" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">now saw</span>

                        could equally share,</span>

                        of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,
                        must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_03499" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">As they approached Barton,
                        indeed, and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought
                        some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent and thoughtful,
                        and turning away her face from their notice, sat earnestly gazing through
                        the window. But here, Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she
                        saw, as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying,
                        she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender
                        than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole of
                        her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to
                        reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common
                        sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of
                        resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight
                        of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.
                        — She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness, and
                        though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without the
                        atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went
                        to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera, procured
                        for her by Willoughby, containing some of their favourite duets, and bearing
                        on its outward leaf her own name in his hand-writing. —</span>

                        anticipating the pleasure of Margaret's return, and talking of the dear
                        family party which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and
                        cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.</span>

                            together every day. We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,

                            plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland; and we will often go the
                            old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its foundations as far as we
                            are told they once reached. I know we shall be happy. I know the summer

                            resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement. But there are many
                            works well worth reading at the Park; and there are others of more
                            modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon. By
                            reading only six hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a
                            twelve-month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to

                        might tempt the daughter's wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne,

                        what I know your judgment must censure. My illness has made me think —
                        It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection. Long before I
                        was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly able to reflect. I considered
                        the past: I saw in my own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance
                        with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and
                        want of kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my
                        sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to
                        the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself
                        by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be
                        wrong. Had I died, — it would have been self-destruction. I did not
                        know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these
                        reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery, — wonder that the very
                        eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God, and to
                        you all, did not kill me at once. Had I died, — in what peculiar
                        misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister! — You,
                        who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known
                        all the murmurings of my heart! — How should I have lived in YOUR
                        remembrance! — My mother too! How could you have consoled her! —
                        I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I looked towards the
                        past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged. Every body seemed
                        injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had
                        repaid with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the
                        Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust;
                        with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their
                        very attention. — To John, to Fanny, — yes, even to them, little
                        as they deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, — you above
                        all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart
                        and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me? — not to any
                        compassion that could benefit you or myself. — Your example was before
                        me; but to what avail? — Was I more considerate of you and your
                        comfort? Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by
                        taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular
                        gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone? — No;
                        — not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you
                        at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely
                        allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only that heart
                        which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an
                        unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake."</span>

                        lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for Willoughby
