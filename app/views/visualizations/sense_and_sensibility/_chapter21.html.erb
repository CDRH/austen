                    <span id="said_no_01248" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Palmers returned to
                        Cleveland the next day, and the two families at Barton were again left to
                        entertain each other. But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly got
                        their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done wondering at
                        Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, at Mr. Palmer's acting so
                        simply, with good abilities, and at the strange unsuitableness which often
                        existed between husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's
                        active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some other new
                        acquaintance to see and observe.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01249" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">In a morning's excursion to
                        Exeter, they had met with two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the
                        satisfaction of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough for Sir
                        John to invite them directly to the park, as soon as their present
                        engagements at Exeter were over. Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave
                        way before such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little
                        alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to
                        receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of
                        whose elegance, — whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no
                        proof; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for
                        nothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much the worse; and
                        Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately
                        founded, when</span>

                        their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put up
                        with one another.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01252" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">As it was impossible,
                        however, now to prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the
                        idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself
                        with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six
                        times every day.</span>

                        their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable. Their dress was
                        very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted with the house,
                        and in raptures with the furniture, and they happened to be so doatingly
                        fond of children that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their
                        favour before they had been an hour at the Park.</span>

                        enthusiastic admiration. Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with
                        this animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the
                        Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival, and to</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01263" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir John wanted the whole
                        family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests. Benevolent,
                        philanthropic man! It was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to
                        himself.</span>

                            you will like them. Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured and
                            agreeable! The children are all hanging about her already, as if she was
                            an old acquaintance. And they both long to see you of all things, for
                            they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in
                            the world; and I have told them it is all very true, and a great deal
                            more. You will be delighted with them I am sure. They have brought the
                            whole coach full of playthings for the children. How can you be so cross
                            as not to come? Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.
                            YOU are my cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must be
                            related."</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01267" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">But Sir John could not
                        prevail. He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within
                        a day or two, and then left them in amazement at their indifference, to walk
                        home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been
                        already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01268" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">When their promised visit to
                        the Park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place, they
                        found in the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very
                        plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was
                        not more than two or three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable
                        beauty; her features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a
                        smartness of air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace,
                        gave distinction to her person. — Their manners were particularly
                        civil, and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she
                        saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves
                        agreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual
                        raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their
                        whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate
                        demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of
                        whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing, or
                        in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance the
                        day before had thrown them into unceasing delight. Fortunately for those who
                        pay their court through such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of
                        praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the
                        most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing;
                        and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her
                        offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest
                        surprise or distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent
                        encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted. She saw
                        their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their work-bags
                        searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of
                        its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no other surprise than that
                        Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by, without claiming a share in
                        what was passing.</span>

                        observed,</span>

                            caressing a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for
                            the last two minutes;</span>
                        <span id="said_no_01276" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Middleton" data-placement="auto top">"And she is always so
                            gentle and quiet — Never was there such a quiet little

                    <span id="said_no_01277" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">But unfortunately in
                        bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly
                        scratching the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness such
                        violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly
                        noisy. The mother's consternation was excessive; but it could not surpass
                        the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three, in so
                        critical an emergency, which affection could suggest as likely to assuage
                        the agonies of the little sufferer. She was seated in her mother's lap,
                        covered with kisses, her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the
                        Miss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with
                        sugar plums by the other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was
                        too wise to cease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her
                        two brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were
                        ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of
                        similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully
                        applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this
                        unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady
                        on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.
                        — She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother's arms, in
                        quest of this medicine, and as the two boys chose to follow, though
                        earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies
                        were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours.</span>

                        for Edward, than he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather
                        his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural;
                        and since Edward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking
                        to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks,
                        as to excite general attention. The letter F —had been likewise
                        invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless jokes,
                        that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long
                        established with Elinor.</span>

                        expected, had now all the benefit of these jokes, and in the eldest of them
                        they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to, which,
                        though often impertinently expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her
                        general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their family. But Sir John did
                        not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at
                        least as much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing

                        Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck her as being rather
                        ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion of that lady's knowing, or fancying
                        herself to know something to his disadvantage. — But her curiosity was
                        unavailing, for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss
