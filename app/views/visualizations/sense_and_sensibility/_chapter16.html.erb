                    <span id="said_no_00760" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Marianne would have thought
                        herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night
                        after parting from Willoughby. She would have been ashamed to look her
                        family in the face the next morning, had she not risen from her bed in more
                        need of repose than when she lay down in it. But the feelings which made
                        such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was
                        awake the whole night, and she wept the greatest part of it. She got up with
                        a headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;
                        giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all
                        attempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent
                        enough!</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00761" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">When breakfast was over she
                        walked out by herself, and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging
                        the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for
                        the chief of the morning.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00762" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The evening passed off in
                        the equal indulgence of feeling. She played over every favourite song that
                        she had been used to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices had
                        been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of
                        music that he had written out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no
                        farther sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day
                        applied. She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and
                        crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears. In books too, as
                        well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past
                        and present was certain of giving. She read nothing but what they had been
                        used to read together.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00763" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Such violence of affliction
                        indeed could not be supported for ever; it sunk within a few days into a
                        calmer melancholy; but these employments, to which she daily recurred, her
                        solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced occasional effusions
                        of sorrow as lively as ever.</span>

                        came; and none seemed expected by Marianne. Her mother was surprised, and
                        Elinor again became uneasy. But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations
                        whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.</span>

                            acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were

                        silence. But there was one method so direct, so simple, and in her opinion
                        so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair, and of instantly
                        removing all mystery, that she could not help suggesting it to her

                            natural result of your affection for her. She used to be all unreserve,
                            and to you more especially."</span>

                        most ungenerous. I should never deserve her confidence again, after forcing
                        from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to
                        any one. I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that
                        I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances
                        make the revealment of it eligible. I would not attempt to force the
                        confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty would
                        prevent the denial which her wishes might direct."</span>

                        generosity overstrained, considering her sister's youth, and urged the

                        were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.</span>

                        Willoughby's name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family; Sir
                        John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice; their witticisms added
                        pain to many a painful hour; — but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood,
                        accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,</span>

                        what she had said; but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply from
                        Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his
                        intentions.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00780" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">One morning, about a week
                        after his leaving the country, Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters
                        in their usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself. Hitherto she had
                        carefully avoided every companion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to
                        walk on the downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked
                        of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be
                        found when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the
                        exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion. They
                        walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence, for
                        Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with gaining
                        one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the entrance of the valley,
                        where the country, though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long
                        stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to Barton, lay
                        before them; and on reaching that point, they stopped to look around them,
                        and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the
                        cottage, from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their
                        walks before.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00781" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Amongst the objects in the
                        scene, they soon discovered an animated one; it was a man on horseback
                        riding towards them. In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a
                        gentleman; and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,</span>
                </p>

                    <span id="said_no_00782" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Marianne Dashwood" data-placement="auto top">"It is he; it is indeed;

                    <span id="said_no_00783" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">and was hastening to meet
                        him, when Elinor cried out,</span>

                        spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost
                        certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with
                        her. They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked
                        again; her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was
                        hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain
                        her; a third, almost as well known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging
                        her to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward
                        Ferrars.</span>

                        the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby; the
                        only one who could have gained a smile from her; but she dispersed her tears
                        to smile on HIM, and in her sister's happiness forgot for a time her own
                        disappointment.</span>

                        his horse to his servant, walked back with them to Barton, whither he was
                        purposely coming to visit them.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00791" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">He was welcomed by them all
                        with great cordiality, but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of
                        regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself. To Marianne,
                        indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of
                        that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their
                        mutual behaviour. On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a
                        deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He
                        was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked
                        neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by
                        questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne saw
                        and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a dislike of
                        Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back
                        her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently
                        striking to those of his brother elect.</span>
