                        so, by engaging in her accustomary employments. But a day spent in sitting
                        shivering over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to
                        read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in
                        favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed, more and
                        more indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister's
                        composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole day, against
                        Marianne's inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her at night,
                        trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and felt no
                        real alarm.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_03190" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">A very restless and feverish
                        night, however, disappointed the expectation of both; and when Marianne,
                        after persisting in rising, confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned
                        voluntarily to her bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's
                        advice, of sending for the Palmers' apothecary.</span>

                        patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days
                        would restore her sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder to have
                        a putrid tendency, and allowing the word "infection" to pass his lips, gave
                        instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer, on her baby's account. Mrs. Jennings, who had
                        been inclined from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than
                        Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming
                        Charlotte's fears and caution,</span>

                        treating their apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of
                        his wife too great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on;
                        and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her little
                        boy and his nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who
                        lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised,
                        at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she was
                        almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her.</span>

                        not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of

                        mother she had taken her from;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03199" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">and Elinor found her on
                        every occasion a most willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all
                        her fatigues, and often by her better experience in nursing, of material
                        use.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_03200" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Poor Marianne, languid and
                        low from the nature of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill,
                        could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered; and the idea of
                        what tomorrow would have produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every
                        ailment severe; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home;
                        and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have
                        taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she
                        said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to
                        raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believed
                        herself, that it would be a very short one.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_03201" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The next day produced little
                        or no alteration in the state of the patient; she certainly was not better,
                        and, except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse. Their party
                        was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well
                        from real humanity and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be
                        frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to
                        perform his promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go,
                        Colonel Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of
                        going likewise. â€” Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings
                        interposed most acceptably; for</span>

                        away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's account, would
                        be to deprive them both,</span>

                        was necessary to herself, that she should want him to play at piquet of an

                        strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying the first wish of his own
                        heart by a compliance, could not long even affect to demur; especially as
                        Mrs. Jennings's entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to
                        feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person so well able to
                        assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.</span>

                        kept in ignorance of all these arrangements. She knew not that she had been
                        the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away, in about seven days from
                        the time of their arrival. It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of
                        Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her
                        name.</span>

                        the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her situation continued, with little
                        variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who attended her every day, still talked
                        boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the
                        expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful.</span>

                        chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings, was not in a
                        state of mind to resist their influence. He tried to reason himself out of
                        fears, which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render
                        absurd; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone,
                        were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea, and he
                        could not expel from his mind</span>

                        day however, the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away; for
                        when Mr. Harris arrived,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03219" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">he declared</span>

                        materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more

                    <span id="said_no_03221" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elinor, confirmed in every
                        pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her letters to her
                        mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend's, in making
                        very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland; and almost
                        fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_03222" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">But the day did not close so
                        auspiciously as it began. â€” Towards the evening Marianne became ill
                        again, growing more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before. Her
                        sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to attribute the change to
                        nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made; and
                        carefully administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction,
                        sink at last into a slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial
                        effects. Her sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a
                        considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she
                        resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings, knowing
                        nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her maid,
                        who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in the
                        housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne.</span>

                        became more and more disturbed; and her sister, who watched, with
                        unremitting attention her continual change of posture, and heard the
                        frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips, was
                        almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber, when Marianne,
                        suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house, started hastily up,
                        and, with feverish wildness, cried out, â€”</span>

                        exactness the time in which she might look for his return. Not a moment was
                        lost in delay of any kind. The horses arrived, even before they were
                        expected, and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of
                        solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the
                        carriage. It was then about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's

                        patient, he would not allow the danger to be material, and talked of the

                        which, in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor. He promised to call
                        again in the course of three or four hours, and left both the patient and

                        with many reproaches for not being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings
                        hear in the morning of what had passed. Her former apprehensions, now with
                        greater reason restored, left her no doubt of the event; and though trying
                        to speak comfort to Elinor, her conviction of her sister's danger would not
                        allow her to offer the comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The
                        rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must
                        have struck a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's
                        compassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her
                        companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly
                        injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too, particularly a

                        his second visit; â€” but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of
                        what the last would produce. His medicines had failed; â€” the fever was
                        unabated; and Marianne only more quiet â€” not more herself â€”
                        remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching all, and more than all, his
                        fears in a moment, proposed to call in further advice. But he judged it
                        unnecessary: he had still something more to try, some more fresh
                        application, of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his visit
                        concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear, but could not
                        enter the heart of Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of
                        her mother; but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued
                        till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering
                        from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits
                        oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who scrupled
                        not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of
                        previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment had brought on.
                        Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it gave fresh misery to
                        her reflections.</span>

                        began â€” but with a caution â€” a dread of disappointment which for
                        some time kept her silent, even to her friend â€” to fancy, to hope she
                        could perceive a slight amendment in her sister's pulse; â€” she waited,
                        watched, and examined it again and again; â€” and at last, with an
                        agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness, than all her
                        foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though
                        forced, on examination, to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep
                        her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance; â€” and
                        Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not
                        to hope. But it was too late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its
                        anxious flutter, she bent over her sister to watch â€” she hardly knew
                        for what. Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed
                        her. Others even arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all
                        flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her
                        with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in
                        equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of
                        Mr. Harris at four o'clock; â€” when his assurances, his felicitations
                        on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation, gave her
                        confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.</span>

                        admitted, with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the

                        mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort,
                        and expand it in fervent gratitude; â€” but it led to no outward
                        demonstrations of joy, no words, no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was

                        Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room
                        to tea. Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of dinner by their
                        sudden reverse, from eating much; â€” and the present refreshment,
                        therefore, with such feelings of content as she brought to it, was
                        particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its
                        conclusion, to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to
                        take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no
                        capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was not to be kept
                        away from her sister an unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore
                        attending her up stairs into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all
                        continued right, left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and
                        retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.</span>

                        stormy. The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the
                        windows; but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not. Marianne slept
                        through every blast; and the travellers â€” they had a rich reward in
                        store, for every present inconvenience.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_03262" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The clock struck eight. Had
                        it been ten, Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard
                        a carriage driving up to the house; and so strong was the persuasion that
                        she DID, in spite of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,
                        that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window
                        shutter, to be satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had
                        not deceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.
                        By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by
                        four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor mother's alarm,
                        gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.</span>

                        found it so difficult to be calm, as at that moment. The knowledge of what
                        her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door â€” of her
                        doubt â€” her dread â€” perhaps her despair! â€” and of what SHE
                        had to tell! â€” with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm. All
                        that remained to be done was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till
                        she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister, she hurried down
                        stairs.</span>

                        as she passed along an inner lobby, assured her that they were already in
                        the house. She rushed to the drawing-room, â€” she entered it, â€”
                        and saw only Willoughby.</span>
