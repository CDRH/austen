                    <span id="said_no_00221" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Barton Park was about half a
                        mile from the cottage. The ladies had passed near it in their way along the
                        valley, but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a
                        hill. The house was large and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style
                        of equal hospitality and elegance. The former was for Sir John's
                        gratification, the latter for that of his lady. They were scarcely ever
                        without some friends staying with them in the house, and they kept more
                        company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood. It was
                        necessary to the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and
                        outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of
                        talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with such as
                        society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a sportsman,
                        Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she humoured her children;
                        and these were their only resources. Lady Middleton had the advantage of
                        being able to spoil her children all the year round, while Sir John's
                        independent employments were in existence only half the time. Continual
                        engagements at home and abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of
                        nature and education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave
                        exercise to the good breeding of his wife.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00222" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lady Middleton piqued
                        herself upon the elegance of her table, and of all her domestic
                        arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any
                        of their parties. But Sir John's satisfaction in society was much more real;
                        he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would
                        hold, and the noisier they were the better was he pleased. He was a blessing
                        to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever
                        forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his
                        private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering
                        under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00223" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The arrival of a new family
                        in the country was always a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view
                        he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at
                        Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough
                        to secure his good opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl
                        could want to make her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness
                        of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation
                        might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In showing
                        kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good
                        heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all
                        the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only
                        those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of
                        encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own
                        manor.</span>

                        himself; a particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was
                        neither very young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the
                        smallness of the party, and could assure them it should never happen so
                        again. He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring
                        some addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full
                        of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton within
                        the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman, he hoped the
                        young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine.</span>

                        their mother, were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of
                        the party, and wished for no more.</span>

                        Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who
                        talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar. She was full of
                        jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said many witty things on
                        the subject of lovers and husbands;</span>

                        blush whether they did or not. Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's
                        sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks,
                        with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from
                        such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's.</span>

                        of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his
                        friend, than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady
                        Middleton's mother. He was silent and grave. His appearance however was not
                        unpleasing, in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret </span>

                        of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome, his countenance

                        the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the
                        cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive, that in
                        comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous
                        mirth of Sir John and his mother-in-law was interesting. Lady Middleton
                        seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy
                        children after dinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an
                        end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves.</span>

                        was discovered to be musical, she was invited to play. The instrument was
                        unlocked, every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very
                        well, at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady
                        Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had
                        lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had
                        celebrated that event by giving up music, although by her mother's account,
                        she had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00244" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Marianne's performance was
                        highly applauded. Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every
                        song, and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song
                        lasted. Lady Middleton frequently called him to order, wondered how any
                        one's attention could be diverted from music for a moment, and asked
                        Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished. Colonel
                        Brandon alone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures. He
                        paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on
                        the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless
                        want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that
                        ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was estimable
                        when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others; and she
                        was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have
                        outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment.
                        She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel's
                        advanced state of life which humanity required.</span>
