                        was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness
                        to ascertain the fact. Whatever the truth of it might be, and far as Elinor
                        was from feeling thorough contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne
                        in spirits, she could not be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in
                        spirits; happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her
                        expectation of a frost.</span>

                        spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance to
                        inform them of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time busy in
                        observing the direction of the wind, watching the variations of the sky and
                        imagining an alteration in the air.</span>

                        difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff. It was not so
                        yesterday, I think. The clouds seem parting too, the sun will be out in a
                        moment, and we shall have a clear afternoon."</span>

                        diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the
                        brightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance of the
                        atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.</span>

                        greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and
                        set of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves, which was
                        invariably kind. Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on
                        the most liberal plan, and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady
                        Middleton's regret, she had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an
                        introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions.
                        Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than
                        she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much
                        real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or
                        abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.</span>

                        general invitation to the house, was with them almost every day; he came to
                        look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived more satisfaction
                        from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence, but who saw
                        at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister. She
                        feared it was a strengthening regard. It grieved her to see the earnestness
                        with which he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse
                        than when at Barton.</span>

                        to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped with the precious

                        the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of her sister all, and more than
                        all, their former agitation. From this moment her mind was never quiet; the
                        expectation of seeing him every hour of the day, made her unfit for any
                        thing. She insisted on being left behind, the next morning, when the others
                        went out.</span>

                        of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a
                        moment's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her,
                        that Willoughby had paid no second visit there. A note was just then brought
                        in, and laid on the table.</span>

                        servant let me in today, accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to
                        Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing. I came to inquire, but I was
                        convinced before I could ask the question. Is every thing finally settled?
                        Is it impossible to-? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of
                        succeeding. Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong in saying
                        so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I have the
                        strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on, that
                        any attempt, that in short concealment, if concealment be possible, is all
                        that remains."</span>
