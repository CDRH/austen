                        conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon
                        were, the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to
                        see. Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for
                        she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made
                        neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and
                        seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But though
                        this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried
                        home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it, in her
                        no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called, in her speaking to him,
                        even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of compassionate respect, and though
                        she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before, she did not see
                        her less wretched. Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a
                        gloomy dejection. She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more
                        heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart;</span>

                        desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of
                        what his designs might ONCE have been on herself,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02219" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">preyed altogether so much on
                        her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even
                        to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her
                        sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent
                        confession of them.</span>

                        be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and
                        said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne's, and an
                        indignation even greater than Elinor's. Long letters from her, quickly
                        succeeding each other, arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to
                        express her anxious solicitude for Marianne,</span>

                        mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which SHE

                        own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better
                        for Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton, where every
                        thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and
                        most afflicting manner, by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as
                        she had always seen him there.</span>

                        Willoughby again, her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in
                        town as in the country, since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all
                        who called themselves her friends. Design could never bring them in each
                        other's way: negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and
                        chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the
                        retirement of Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that
                        visit at Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at
                        first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain

                        the personal sympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and such

                        her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's name mentioned, was not thrown
                        away. Marianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all its advantage;
                        for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever
                        spoke of him before her. Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have
                        extended towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to

                        business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart. He would not speak
                        another word to him, meet him where he might, for all the world! No, not if
                        it were to be by the side of Barton covert, and they were kept watching for
                        two hours together. Such a scoundrel of a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It

                        too far off to visit; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to
                        mention his name again, and she should tell everybody she saw, how

                        at what coachmaker's the new carriage was building, by what painter Mr.
                        Willoughby's portrait was drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes

                        others. It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in
                        ONE person at least among their circle of friends: a great comfort to know
                        that there was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after
                        particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's health.</span>

                        value; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate
                        good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good-nature.</span>

                        without recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the
                        dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in
                        the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her
                        own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather against the opinion
                        of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance
                        and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married.</span>

                        unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood. He had
                        abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister's
                        disappointment, by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften
                        it, and they always conversed with confidence. His chief reward for the
                        painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations, was
                        given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the
                        gentleness of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was
