                        Norland several months; not from any disinclination to move when the sight
                        of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it
                        produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive, and her mind
                        became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its
                        affliction by melancholy remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and
                        indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood
                        of Norland; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she
                        could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and
                        ease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier
                        judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which her
                        mother would have approved.</span>

                        informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in
                        their favour, which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections. She
                        doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it
                        himself, and she thought of it for her daughters' sake with satisfaction,
                        though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than
                        7000L would support her in affluence. For their brother's sake, too, for the
                        sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and </span>

                    <span id="said_no_00091" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">His attentive behaviour to
                        herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him,
                        and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the liberality of his
                        intentions.</span>

                        very early in their acquaintance, felt for her daughter-in-law, was very
                        much increased by the farther knowledge of her character, which half a
                        year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps in spite of every
                        consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former,
                        the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so
                        long, had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater
                        eligibility, according to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters'
                        continuance at Norland.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00093" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">This circumstance was a
                        growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John
                        Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced to
                        their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment at Norland, and who
                        had since spent the greatest part of his time there.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00094" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Some mothers might have
                        encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the
                        eldest son of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed it
                        from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his
                        fortune depended on the will of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike
                        uninfluenced by either consideration. It was enough for her that he appeared
                        to be amiable, that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the
                        partiality. It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of
                        fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
                        disposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged by every one
                        who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.</span>
                </p>

                    <span id="said_no_00095" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edward Ferrars was not
                        recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or
                        address. He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy to make them
                        pleasing. He was too diffident to do justice to himself; but when his
                        natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of an
                        open, affectionate heart. His understanding was good, and his education had
                        given it solid improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor
                        disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see
                        him distinguished — as — they hardly knew what. They wanted him
                        to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other. His mother
                        wished to interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or
                        to see him connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John
                        Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these
                        superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her ambition to
                        see him driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for great men or
                        barouches. All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of
                        private life. Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more
                        promising.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00096" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edward had been staying
                        several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's
                        attention; for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered her
                        careless of surrounding objects. She saw only that he was quiet and
                        unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He did not disturb the wretchedness
                        of her mind by ill-timed conversation. She was first called to observe and
                        approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on
                        the difference between him and his sister. It was a contrast which
                        recommended him most forcibly to her mother.</span>

                        to get acquainted with him. Her manners were attaching, and soon banished
                        his reserve. She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his
                        regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt
                        assured of his worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated
                        against all her established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be,
                        was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his

                            some surprise. Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet
                            — he is not the kind of young man — there is something
                            wanting — his figure is not striking; it has none of that grace
                            which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister.
                            His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once announce virtue
                            and intelligence. And besides all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no
                            real taste. Music seems scarcely to attract him, and though he admires
                            Elinor's drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person who
                            can understand their worth. It is evident, in spite of his frequent
                            attention to her while she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the
                            matter. He admires as a lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me,
                            those characters must be united. I could not be happy with a man whose
                            taste did not in every point coincide with my own. He must enter into
                            all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both. Oh!
                            mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last
                            night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much
                            composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my
                            seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven
                            me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful
                            indifference!" — </span>

                        Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and be happy
                        with him. But it would have broke MY heart, had I loved him, to hear him
                        read with so little sensibility. Mama, the more I know of the world, the
