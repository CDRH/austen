                        he left her, for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died
                        away, remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in
                        themselves, but of which sadness was the general result, to think even of
                        her sister.</span>

                        only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men,
                        Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration
                        for the sufferings produced by them,</span>

                        her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have

                        lively manner which it was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent
                        love for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.</span>

                        before she could feel his influence less.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_03432" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">When at last she returned to
                        the unconscious Marianne, she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long
                        and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes. Elinor's heart was full. The
                        past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and
                        her mother's expected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of
                        spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made her only
                        fearful of betraying herself to her sister. Short was the time, however, in
                        which that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's
                        leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of another
                        carriage. — Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment's
                        horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the
                        outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered
                        it.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_03433" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror
                        as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's
                        being no more, had no voice to inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor;
                        but SHE, waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the
                        joyful relief; — and her mother, catching it with all her usual
                        warmth, was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she had been
                        before by her fears. She was supported into the drawing-room between her
                        daughter and her friend; — and there, shedding tears of joy, though
                        still unable to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at
                        intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at once
                        her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss
                        of the moment. He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her
                        own.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_03434" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had
                        recovered herself, to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes
                        she was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever by absence,
                        unhappiness, and danger. Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the
                        meeting, was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of
                        farther sleep; — but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even
                        prudent, when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in
                        knowing her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for
                        conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every
                        nurse around her. Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor,
                        in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed. But the rest, which
                        one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most wearing anxiety
                        seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.
                        Willoughby,</span>

                    <span id="said_no_03436" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">as she now allowed herself
                        to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would not but have heard
                        his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now acquitted herself for
                        having judged him so harshly before. But her promise of relating it to her
                        sister was invariably painful. She dreaded the performance of it, dreaded
                        what its effect on Marianne might be; doubted whether after such an
                        explanation she could ever be happy with another; and for a moment wished
                        Willoughby a widower. Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved
                        herself,</span>

                        his constancy far more than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was

                    <span id="said_no_03439" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">and wished any thing rather

                        Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her
                        own previous alarm; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she
                        had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day, without
                        waiting for any further intelligence, and had so far settled her journey
                        before his arrival, that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch
                        Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be
                        infection.</span>

                        increase it.</span>

                        she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It was thus
                        imparted to her, as soon as any opportunity of private conference between
                        them occurred.</span>

                            he has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect
                            him; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very
                            considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him, that if Marianne
                            can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think our
                            connection the greatest blessing to us in the world. What answer did you

                        dying. But he did not ask for hope or encouragement. His was an involuntary
                        confidence, an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend — not an
                        application to a parent. Yet after a time I DID say, for at first I was
                        quite overcome — that if she lived, as I trusted she might, my
                        greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage; and since our
                        arrival, since our delightful security, I have repeated it to him more
                        fully, have given him every encouragement in my power. Time, a very little
                        time, I tell him, will do everything; — Marianne's heart is not to be
                        wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby. — His own merits must
                        soon secure it."</span>

                        length of time, and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident of
                        himself to believe, that with such a difference of age and disposition he
                        could ever attach her. There, however, he is quite mistaken. His age is only
                        so much beyond hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and
                        principles fixed; — and his disposition, I am well convinced, is
                        exactly the very one to make your sister happy. And his person, his manners
                        too, are all in his favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is
                        not so handsome as Willoughby — but at the same time, there is
                        something much more pleasing in his countenance. — There was always a
                        something, — if you remember, — in Willoughby's eyes at times,
                        which I did not like."</span>

                        Marianne. Their gentleness, their genuine attention to other people, and
                        their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real
                        disposition, than the liveliness — often artificial, and often
                        ill-timed of the other. I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby turned
                        out as really amiable, as he has proved himself the contrary, Marianne would
                        yet never have been so happy with HIM, as she will be with Colonel
