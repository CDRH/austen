                        immediately to their room on her return, and without waiting to have her
                        request of admittance answered, opened the door and walked in with a look of
                        real concern.</span>

                        compassion to Marianne, who turned away her face without attempting to
                        answer.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02047" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs Jennings" data-placement="auto top">"How is she, Miss Dashwood?
                        — Poor thing! she looks very bad. — No wonder. Ay, it is but too
                        true. He is to be married very soon — a good-for-nothing fellow! I
                        have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago, and
                        she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure
                        I should not have believed it; and I was almost ready to sink as it was.
                        Well, said I, all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used a young
                        lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife
                        may plague his heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend
                        on it. I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever I meet
                        him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a
                        day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only
                        young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face you will
                        never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won't disturb her any longer, for
                        she had better have her cry out at once and have done with. The Parrys and
                        Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse
                        her."</span>

                        on tiptoe out of the room, as if she supposed her young friend's affliction
                        could be increased by noise.</span>

                        her sister, determined on dining with them. Elinor even advised her against
                        it. But</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02050" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Marianne Dashwood" data-placement="auto top">"no, she would go down; she

                        governed for a moment by such a motive, though believing it hardly possible
                        that she could sit out the dinner, said no more; and adjusting her dress for
                        her as well as she could, while Marianne still remained on the bed, was
                        ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to
                        it.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02052" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">When there, though looking
                        most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected.
                        Had she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings's
                        well-meant but ill-judged attentions to her, this calmness could not have
                        been maintained; but not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of
                        her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing
                        before her.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_02053" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elinor, who did justice to
                        Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though its effusions were often distressing, and
                        sometimes almost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments, and returned
                        her those civilities, which her sister could not make or return for herself.
                        Their good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing
                        was due to her which might make her at all less so. She treated her
                        therefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite
                        child on the last day of its holidays. Marianne was to have the best place
                        by the fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to
                        be amused by the relation of all the news of the day. Had not Elinor, in the
                        sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she could have
                        been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in
                        love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire. As soon,
                        however, as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition
                        on Marianne, she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of Misery,
                        and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got up and hurried
                        out of the room.</span>

                            good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would send all
                            over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to me, that a man
                            should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there is plenty of money
                            on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless you! they care no
                            more about such things! — "</span>

                        handsome. I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very
                        wealthy man. But the family are all rich together. Fifty thousand pounds!
                        and by all accounts, it won't come before it's wanted; for they say he is
                        all to pieces. No wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well,
                        it don't signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and
                        makes love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to
                        fly off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is ready
                        to have him. Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house,
                        turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you,
                        Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round. But
                        that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given

                        gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth. After a short silence
                        on both sides, Mrs. Jennings, with all her natural hilarity, burst forth

                        saying about an ill-wind, for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon.
                        He will have her at last; aye, that he will. Mind me, now, if they an't
                        married by Mid-summer. Lord! how he'll chuckle over this news! I hope he
                        will come tonight. It will be all to one a better match for your sister. Two
                        thousand a year without debt or drawback — except the little
                        love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her; but she may be 'prenticed out at
                        a small cost, and then what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can
                        tell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts
                        and conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered
                        with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one
                        corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there!
                        Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty
                        canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it
                        is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike-road,
                        so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour
                        behind the house, you may see all the carriages that pass along. Oh! 'tis a
                        nice place! A butcher hard by in the village, and the parsonage-house within
                        a stone's throw. To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park,
                        where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a
                        neighbour nearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as
                        soon as I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we
                        CAN but put Willoughby out of her head!"</span>
