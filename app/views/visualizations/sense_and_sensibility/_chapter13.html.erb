                        Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected. She was
                        prepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened; but the event was
                        still more unfortunate, for they did not go at all.</span>

                        party was assembled at the park, where they were to breakfast. The morning
                        was rather favourable, though it had rained all night, as the clouds were
                        then dispersing across the sky, and the sun frequently appeared. They were
                        all in high spirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to
                        submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be
                        otherwise.</span>

                        this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose,
                        or Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it, with
                        whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.</span>

                        dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it; and great was her surprise
                        when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings was
                        perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it.</span>

                        it what you have often wished to do yourself?"</span>

                        an open carriage, it was impossible to have any other companion. I never
                        spent a pleasanter morning in my life."</span>

                        impropriety in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at the time,
                        for we always know when we are acting wrong, and with such a conviction I
                        could have had no pleasure."</span>

                        should do her commendation. I am not sensible of having done anything wrong
                        in walking over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house. They will one

                        but it was even visibly gratifying to her; and after a ten minutes' interval
                        of earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said with great good

                        rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted
                        particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure you.
                        â€” There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice
                        comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would be
                        delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides. On one side
                        you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a beautiful hanging
                        wood, and on the other you have a view of the church and village, and,
                        beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired. I did
                        not see it to advantage, for nothing could be more forlorn than the
                        furniture, â€” but if it were newly fitted up â€” a couple of
                        hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the pleasantest
                        summer-rooms in England."</span>
