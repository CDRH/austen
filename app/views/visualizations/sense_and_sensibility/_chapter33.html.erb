                        Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties, and consented to go out with
                        her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour. She expressly
                        conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and would do no more than
                        accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a
                        negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her
                        mother.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_02319" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">When they stopped at the
                        door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of
                        the street on whom she ought to call; and as she had no business at Gray's,
                        it was resolved, that while her young friends transacted their's, she should
                        pay her visit and return for them.</span>
                </p>

                    <span id="said_no_02320" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">On ascending the stairs, the
                        Miss Dashwoods found so many people before them in the room, that there was
                        not a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they were obliged to
                        wait. All that could be done was, to sit down at that end of the counter
                        which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was
                        standing there, and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of
                        exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch. But the correctness of his
                        eye, and the delicacy of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He
                        was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size,
                        shape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and
                        debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop,
                        were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to
                        bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised in
                        three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to imprint on
                        Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong, natural, sterling
                        insignificance, though adorned in the first style of fashion.</span>

                        troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment, on this impertinent
                        examination of their features, and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding
                        on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases presented to
                        his inspection, by remaining unconscious of it all; for she was as well able
                        to collect her thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was
                        passing around her, in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.</span>

                        decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls, all received their
                        appointment, and the gentleman having named the last day on which his
                        existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case,
                        drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and bestowing another glance on the
                        Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express
                        admiration, walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected
                        indifference.</span>

                        bringing her business forward, was on the point of concluding it, when
                        another gentleman presented himself at her side. She turned her eyes towards
                        his face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.</span>

                        in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr.
                        Gray's shop. John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his
                        sisters again; it rather gave them satisfaction; and his inquiries after
                        their mother were respectful and attentive.</span>

                            Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars. Harry was
                            vastly pleased. THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you, if I
                            could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much to do
                            on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal. But
                            tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street,
                            and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. I understand she is a
                            woman of very good fortune. And the Middletons too, you must introduce
                            me to THEM. As my mother-in-law's relations, I shall be happy to show
                            them every respect. They are excellent neighbours to you in the country,

                        accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be
                        reasonably expected. And so you are most comfortably settled in your little

                        the place: the most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and
                        you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. It was a great satisfaction to

                        which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be

                            ladies can so easily give will fix him, in spite of himself. And there
                            can be no reason why you should not try for him. It is not to be

                            the objections are insurmountable — you have too much sense not to
                            see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man; and no civility shall be
                            wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family. It is a
                            match that must give universal satisfaction. In short, it is a kind of

                        to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel
                        Brandon; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be
                        relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that
                        gentleman, and promoting the marriage by every possible attention. He had
                        just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to
                        be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an
                        offer from Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest
                        means of atoning for his own neglect.</span>

                        find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.
                        Abundance of civilities passed on all sides. Sir John was ready to like
                        anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses, he
                        soon set him down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw
                        enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having;
                        and Mr. Dashwood went away delighted with both.</span>

                            really a most elegant woman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be
                            glad to know. And Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman,
                            though not so elegant as her daughter. Your sister need not have any
                            scruple even of visiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little
                            the case, and very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was
                            the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and
                            Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her
                            daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with.
                            But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both."</span>
