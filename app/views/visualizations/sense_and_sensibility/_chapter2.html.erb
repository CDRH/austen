                    <span id="said_no_00023" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. John Dashwood now
                        installed herself mistress of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law
                        were degraded to the condition of visitors. As such, however, they were
                        treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband with as much kindness
                        as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself, his wife, and their child.
                        He really pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their
                        home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining
                        there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood,
                        his invitation was accepted.</span>

                        where everything reminded her of former delight, was exactly what suited her
                        mind. In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful than
                        hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine expectation of
                        happiness which is happiness itself. But in sorrow she must be equally
                        carried away by her fancy, and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she
                        was beyond alloy.</span>

                        them; and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty. An annuity is a
                        very serious business; it comes over and over every year, and there is no
                        getting rid of it. You are not aware of what you are doing. I have known a
                        great deal of the trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the
                        payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it
                        is amazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these annuities
                        were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and
                        then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be
                        no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it.</span>

                        I did should be done at my own discretion entirely. I would not bind myself
                        to allow them any thing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to
                        spare a hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses."</span>

                        whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than
                        a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge their style of living if
                        they felt sure of a larger income, and would not be sixpence the richer for
                        it at the end of the year. It will certainly be much the best way. A present
                        of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for
                        money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my

                        to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea
                        of your giving them any money at all. The assistance he thought of, I dare
                        say, was only such as might be reasonably expected of you; for instance,
                        such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them to
                        move their things, and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth,
                        whenever they are in season. I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther;
                        indeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but
                        consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your
                        mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand
                        pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which
                        brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will pay
                        their mother for their board out of it. Altogether, they will have five
                        hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more
                        than that? — They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be
                        nothing at all. They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any
                        servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any kind!
                        Only conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I
                        cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them
                        more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able to give
                        YOU something."</span>
