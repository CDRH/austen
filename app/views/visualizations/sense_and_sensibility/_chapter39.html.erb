                        been rather more than two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be
                        gone increased every day. She sighed for the air, the liberty, the quiet of
                        the country; and</span>

                        give her ease, Barton must do it.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02901" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elinor was hardly less
                        anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent on its
                        being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the difficulties of
                        so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge. She
                        began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment,
                        and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess, who resisted
                        them with all the eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,
                        which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to
                        Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other. The Palmers were to
                        remove to Cleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and
                        Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from
                        Charlotte to go with them. This would not, in itself, have been sufficient
                        for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood; — but it was inforced with so much
                        real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great
                        amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be
                        unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure.</span>

                        the propriety of overcoming such feelings; — she only endeavoured to

                        would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much
                        wished to see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other
                        plan could do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which
                        was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not beyond one
                        day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant might easily
                        come there to attend them down; and as there could be no occasion of their
                        staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at home in little more
                        than three weeks' time.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02914" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">As Marianne's affection for
                        her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty, over the

                        being readily gained, every thing relative to their return was arranged as
                        far as it could be; — and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a
                        statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.</span>

                        hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make
                        that offer, which might give himself an escape from it; — and if so,
                        she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained; for, on
                        Elinor's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a
                        print, which she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it
                        with a look of particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several
                        minutes. The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her
                        observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even
                        changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by the
                        piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep herself from
                        seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation, and was too
                        intent on what he said to pursue her employment. — Still farther in
                        confirmation of her hopes, in the interval of Marianne's turning from one
                        lesson to another, some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear,
                        in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house.</span>

                        What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish, but judged from the
                        motion of her lips, that</span>

                        commended her in her heart for being so honest. They then talked on for a
                        few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another lucky stop
                        in Marianne's performance brought her these words in the Colonel's calm
                        voice, —</span>

                            three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with him. He is not a
                            young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time,
                            but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake, and as
                            a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I understand that he intends to
                            take orders. Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of
                            Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post, is his,
                            if he think it worth his acceptance — but THAT, perhaps, so
                            unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be nonsense to appear
                            to doubt; I only wish it were more valuable. — It is a rectory,
                            but a small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than
                            200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable of improvement, I
                            fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income.
                            Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting him to it, will be
                            very great. Pray assure him of it."</span>
