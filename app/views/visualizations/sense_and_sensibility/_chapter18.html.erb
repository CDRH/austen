                        uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His visit afforded her but a very
                        partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect.
                        It was evident that he was unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that
                        he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no
                        doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed
                        very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted
                        one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.</span>

                        in the breakfast-room the next morning before the others were down; and
                        Marianne, who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she
                        could, soon left them to themselves. But before she was half way upstairs
                        she heard the parlour door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see
                        Edward himself come out.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00953" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edward returned to them with
                        fresh admiration of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village, he
                        had seen many parts of the valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a
                        much higher situation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the
                        whole, which had exceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured
                        Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration
                        of these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that had
                        particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00954" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edward Ferrars" data-placement="auto top">"You must not enquire too
                        far, Marianne — remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque, and I
                        shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to
                        particulars. I shall call hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces
                        strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged; and distant
                        objects out of sight, which ought only to be indistinct through the soft
                        medium of a hazy atmosphere. You must be satisfied with such admiration as I
                        can honestly give. I call it a very fine country — the hills are
                        steep, the woods seem full of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable
                        and snug — with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered
                        here and there. It exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it
                        unites beauty with utility — and I dare say it is a picturesque one
                        too, because you admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and
                        promontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me. I know
                        nothing of the picturesque."</span>

                            really feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater
                            indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he
                            possesses. He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his

                            landscape scenery is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel
                            and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first
                            defined what picturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and
                            sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no
                            language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all
                            sense and meaning."</span>

                            a fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not like
                            crooked, twisted, blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are
                            tall, straight, and flourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered
                            cottages. I am not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I
                            have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower — and a

                        suddenly engaged her attention. She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his
                        tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a
                        ring, with a plait of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his
                        fingers.</span>

                        inconsiderately what she really felt — but when she saw how much she
                        had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thought could not be
                        surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary glance at
                        Elinor, replied,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00973" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edward Ferrars" data-placement="auto top"> "Yes; it is my sister's
                        hair. The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know."</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00974" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elinor had met his eye, and
                        looked conscious likewise. That the hair was her own, she instantaneously
                        felt as well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their conclusions
                        was, that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor
                        was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown
                        to herself. She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,
                        and affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of
                        something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every
                        opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,
                        that it was exactly the shade of her own.</span>

                        lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled. He
                        was particularly grave the whole morning. Marianne severely censured herself
                        for what she had said; but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,
                        had she known how little offence it had given her sister.</span>

                        day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of
                        the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey of the
                        guest. With the assistance of his mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in
                        discovering that the name of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a
                        future mine of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the
                        newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being
                        immediately sprung. But, as it was, she only learned, from some very
                        significant looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's
                        instructions, extended.</span>
