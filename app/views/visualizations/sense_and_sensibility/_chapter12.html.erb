                        walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to
                        her sister, which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne's
                        imprudence and want of thought, surprised her by its extravagant testimony
                        of both.</span>

                        her a horse, one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire,
                        and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00451" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Without considering that it
                        was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter
                        her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the servant,
                        and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable to receive
                        them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and told her sister
                        of it in raptures.</span>

                            downs."</span>

                        which attended the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to

                        servant, the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object
                        to it; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park;
                        as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00459" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top"> This was too much.</span>

                            very little of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am
                            much better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in
                            the world, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that
                            is to determine intimacy; — it is disposition alone. Seven years
                            would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other,
                            and seven days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself
                            guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than
                            from Willoughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived
                            together for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been
                            formed."</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00463" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elinor thought it wisest to
                        touch that point no more. She knew her sister's temper. Opposition on so
                        tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion. But by
                        an appeal to her affection for her mother, by representing the
                        inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself, if (as
                        would probably be the case) she consented to this increase of establishment,
                        Marianne was shortly subdued; and</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00465" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">not to tempt her mother to
                        such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and</span>

                        when she saw him next, that it must be declined.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00467" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was faithful to her
                        word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard
                        her express her disappointment to him in a low voice,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00468" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar_mari" data-placement="auto top">on being obliged to

                    <span id="said_no_00469" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The reasons for this
                        alteration were at the same time related, and they were such as to make
                        further entreaty on his side impossible. His concern however was very
                        apparent; and after expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same
                        low voice, —</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00470" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Willoughby" data-placement="auto top">"But, Marianne, the horse is
                        still yours, though you cannot use it now. I shall keep it only till you can
                        claim it. When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more
                        lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you."</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00471" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was all overheard by
                        Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the sentence, in his manner of
                        pronouncing it, and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name
                        alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning so direct, as
                        marked a perfect agreement between them. From that moment she doubted not of
                        their being engaged to each other; and the belief of it created no other
                        surprise than that she, or any of their friends, should be left by tempers
                        so frank, to discover it by accident.</span>

                        to her the next day, which placed this matter in a still clearer light.
                        Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them, and Margaret, by being
                        left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne, had had
                        opportunity for observations, which, with a most important face, she
                        communicated to her eldest sister, when they were next by themselves.</span>

                        immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion mindful of
                        the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of

                        whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad,
                        had left strict orders on that head. The grounds were declared to be highly
                        beautiful, and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be
                        allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at
                        least, twice every summer for the last ten years. They contained a noble
                        piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning's
                        amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages only to be
                        employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party
