                        dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of
                        announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a
                        house, and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready
                        for her inhabiting it. They heard her with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said
                        nothing; but</span>

                        towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern, which
                        required no explanation to her, repeated, </span>
                    <span id="said_no_00186" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edward Ferrars" data-placement="auto top">"Devonshire! Are you, indeed,
                        going there? So far from hence! And to what part of it?" </span>

                        <span id="said_no_00191" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Dashwood" data-placement="auto top">"but I hope to see many
                            of my friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my
                            friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I
                            will find none in accommodating them."</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00192" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">She concluded with a very
                        kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to
                        Edward she gave one with still greater affection. Though her late
                        conversation with her daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at
                        Norland no longer than was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest
                        effect on her in that point to which it principally tended. To separate
                        Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished
                        to show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how
                        totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00194" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">again and again</span>

                        she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his
                        being of any service to her in removing her furniture.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00196" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">He really felt
                        conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion to which he had
                        limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement
                        rendered impracticable. — The furniture was all sent around by water.
                        It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a
                        handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages
                        depart with a sigh: she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs.
                        Dashwood's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she
                        should have any handsome article of furniture.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00197" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Dashwood took the house
                        for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished, and she might have immediate
                        possession. No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she
                        waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her
                        future household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was
                        exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her, was
                        soon done. — The horses which were left her by her husband had been
                        sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of
                        her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her
                        eldest daughter. For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her
                        own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed.
                        HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three; two maids and
                        a man, with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had
                        formed their establishment at Norland.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00198" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The man and one of the maids
                        were sent off immediately into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their
                        mistress's arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs.
                        Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at
                        Barton Park; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the
                        house, as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as
                        her own. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution
                        by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her
                        removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under
                        a cold invitation to her to defer her departure. Now was the time when her
                        son-in-law's promise to his father might with particular propriety be
                        fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate,
                        their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for
                        its accomplishment. But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope
                        of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general drift of his discourse,
                        that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six
                        months at Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of
                        housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of
                        any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he
                        seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design
                        of giving money away.</span>

                        day which brought Sir John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing
                        was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her
                        daughters to begin their journey.</span>
