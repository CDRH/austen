                        Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its
                        cause, filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or
                        three days; she was a great wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very
                        lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their
                        acquaintance.</span>

                        <span id="said_no_00649" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Jennings" data-placement="auto top">"I could see it in his
                            face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad. The estate at
                            Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year, and his
                            brother left everything sadly involved. I do think he must have been
                            sent for about money matters, for what else can it be? I wonder whether
                            it is so. I would give anything to know the truth of it. Perhaps it is
                            about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is, because he looked
                            so conscious when I mentioned her. May be she is ill in town; nothing in
                            the world more likely, for I have a notion she is always rather sickly.
                            I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams. It is not so very
                            likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW, for he is a
                            very prudent man, and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this
                            time. I wonder what it can be! May be his sister is worse at Avignon,
                            and has sent for him over. His setting off in such a hurry seems very
                            like it. Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart, and
                            a good wife into the bargain."</span>
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00650" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">So wondered, so talked Mrs.
                        Jennings. Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming
                        equally probable as they arose. Elinor, though she felt really interested in
                        the welfare of Colonel Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going
                        so suddenly away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for
                        besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting
                        amazement or variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.
                        It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby
                        on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them
                        all. As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange and
                        more incompatible with the disposition of both. Why they should not openly
                        acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each
                        other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00651" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">She could easily conceive
                        that marriage might not be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby
                        was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich. His estate had
                        been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at
                        an expense to which that income could hardly be equal, and he had himself
                        often complained of his poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy
                        maintained by them relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed
                        nothing at all, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to
                        their general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind
                        of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her
                        making any inquiry of Marianne.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00652" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Nothing could be more
                        expressive of attachment to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour. To
                        Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart
                        could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention
                        of a son and a brother. The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him
                        as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and
                        if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which
                        called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the
                        rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his
                        favourite pointer at her feet.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00653" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">One evening in particular,
                        about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed more
                        than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him;
                        and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the
                        cottage in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which
                        affection had established as perfect with him.</span>

                        the world. Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I
                        make up my accounts in the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by
