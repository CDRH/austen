                    <span id="said_no_01488" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">However small Elinor's
                        general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her on
                        serious reflection to suspect it in the present case, where no temptation
                        could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a
                        description. What Lucy had asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not,
                        dared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every side by such
                        probabilities and proofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes.
                        Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation
                        for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near
                        Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own
                        prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge
                        of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had
                        often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed altogether
                        such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,
                        and established as a fact, which no partiality could set aside, his
                        ill-treatment of herself. — Her resentment of such behaviour, her
                        indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time made her feel only for
                        herself; but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01489" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar_eli" data-placement="auto top">Had Edward been
                        intentionally deceiving her? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did
                        not feel? Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No;
                        whatever it might once have been, she could not believe it such at present.
                        His affection was all her own. She could not be deceived in that. Her
                        mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her at
                        Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. He certainly loved
                        her.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01490" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top"> What a softener of the
                        heart was this persuasion! How much could it not tempt her to
                        forgive!</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01491" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar_eli" data-placement="auto top">He had been blamable,
                        highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence
                        over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he could not be defended;
                        but if he had injured her, how much more had he injured himself; if her case
                        were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence had made her miserable for a
                        while; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being
                        otherwise. She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had he to
                        look forward to? Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could
                        he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with his integrity,
                        his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like her
                        — illiterate, artful, and selfish?</span>

                        infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her
                        beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding years — years, which
                        if rationally spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must have
                        opened his eyes to her defects of education, while the same period of time,
                        spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits, had
                        perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an
                        interesting character to her beauty.</span>

                        of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties from his mother had seemed
                        great, how much greater were they now likely to be, when the object of his
                        engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in
                        fortune to herself. These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated
                        from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was
                        the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and
                        unkindness, could be felt as a relief!</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01494" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">As these considerations
                        occurred to her in painful succession, she wept for him, more than for
                        herself. Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her
                        present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing
                        to forfeit her esteem, she thought she could even now, under the first smart
                        of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the
                        truth from her mother and sisters. And so well was she able to answer her
                        own expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after
                        she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would
                        have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning
                        in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of
                        her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a
                        man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she
                        expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01495" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">The necessity of concealing
                        from her mother and Marianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to
                        herself, though it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no aggravation of
                        Elinor's distress. On the contrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the
                        communication of what would give such affliction to them, and to be saved
                        likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow
                        from the excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more
                        than she felt equal to support.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01496" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">From their counsel, or their
                        conversation, she knew she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and
                        sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command would neither
                        receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise. She was
                        stronger alone, and her own good sense so well supported her, that her
                        firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as
                        with regrets so poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.
                    </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01497" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Much as she had suffered
                        from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an
                        earnest wish of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one. She wanted
                        to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more
                        clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were
                        any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him, and she
                        particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the
                        matter again, and her calmness in conversing on it, that she was no
                        otherwise interested in it than as a friend, which she very much feared her
                        involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least
                        doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very
                        probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,
                        not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to trust her on so
                        short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so confessedly and evidently
                        important. And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had some
                        weight. But indeed, while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of
                        being really beloved by Edward, it required no other consideration of
                        probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she
                        was so, her very confidence was a proof.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01498" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar_eli" data-placement="auto top">What other reason for
                        the disclosure of the affair could there be, but that Elinor might be
                        informed by it of Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid
                        him in future?</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01499" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">She had little difficulty in
                        understanding thus much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly
                        resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed, to
                        combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible;
                        she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that
                        her heart was unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to
                        hear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own
                        ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01500" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">But it was not immediately
                        that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well
                        disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred; for the weather
                        was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they
                        might most easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met
                        at least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at
                        the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.
                        Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton's head;
                        and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat, and
                        none at all for particular discourse. They met for the sake of eating,
                        drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards, or consequences, or any
                        other game that was sufficiently noisy.</span>

                        kind had taken place, without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy
                        in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01502" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">to beg,</span>

                        charity, that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was
                        obliged to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite
                        alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.</span>

                        opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this was likely to
                        be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well-bred
                        direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in
                        one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her
                        mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne, though always
                        unwilling to join any of their parties, was persuaded by her mother, who
                        could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to
                        go likewise.</span>

                        Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had
                        threatened her. The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had
                        expected; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression, and nothing
                        could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the
                        dining parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied
                        them, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the
                        impossibility of engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it. They quitted it
                        only with the removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then placed, and
                        Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of
                        finding time for conversation at the park. They all rose up in preparation
                        for a round game.</span>
