                        next three or four days, to make Elinor regret what she had done, in
                        applying to her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote. They were
                        engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from
                        which Mrs. Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest
                        daughter; and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her
                        appearance, and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid,
                        prepared, without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She sat by
                        the drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton's
                        arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude, lost
                        in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at
                        last</span>

                        waited for them at the door,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01876" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">she started as if she had
                        forgotten that any one was expected.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01877" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">They arrived in due time at
                        the place of destination, and as soon as the string of carriages before them
                        would allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their names announced from
                        one landing-place to another in an audible voice, and entered a room
                        splendidly lit up, quite full of company, and insufferably hot. When they
                        had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house,
                        they were permitted to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat
                        and inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some
                        time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to
                        Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and Elinor
                        luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great distance from
                        the table.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01878" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">They had not remained in
                        this manner long, before Elinor perceived Willoughby, standing within a few
                        yards of them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young
                        woman. She soon caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without
                        attempting to speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but
                        see her; and then continued his discourse with the same lady. Elinor turned
                        involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by her. At
                        that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with
                        sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly, had not her
                        sister caught hold of her.</span>

                        <span id="said_no_01881" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Marianne Dashwood" data-placement="auto top">"he is there — he
                            is there — Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot I speak to

                        <span id="said_no_01884" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elinor Dashwood" data-placement="auto top">"and do not betray what
                            you feel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you
                            yet."</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01885" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">This however was more than
                        she could believe herself; and to be composed at such a moment was not only
                        beyond the reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of
                        impatience which affected every feature.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01886" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">At last he turned round
                        again, and regarded them both; she started up, and pronouncing his name in a
                        tone of affection, held out her hand to him. He approached, and addressing
                        himself rather to Elinor than Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and
                        determined not to observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after
                        Mrs. Dashwood,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01887" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">and asked</span>

                        been in town.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01889" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elinor was robbed of all
                        presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word. But the
                        feelings of her sister were instantly expressed. Her face was crimsoned
                        over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01890" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Marianne Dashwood" data-placement="auto top"> "Good God! Willoughby, what
                        is the meaning of this? Have you not received my letters? Will you not shake
                        hands with me?"</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01891" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">He could not then avoid it,
                        but her touch seemed painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.
                        During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure. Elinor
                        watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil. After
                        a moment's pause, he spoke with calmness.</span>
                </p>

                        was not lost, I hope."</span>

                        he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered himself again, and
                        after saying,</span>

                        dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor,
                        expecting every moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the
                        observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.</span>

                        till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect, was
                        impossible; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to
                        the misery of her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time
                        Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase,

                        polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away, and making over her
                        cards to a friend, they departed as soon the carriage could be found.
                        Scarcely a word was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne
                        was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs.
                        Jennings was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own
                        room, where hartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon
                        undressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her sister
                        then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure
                        enough for thinking over the past.</span>
