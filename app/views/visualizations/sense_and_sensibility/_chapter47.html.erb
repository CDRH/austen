                        unmoved the vindication of her former favourite. She rejoiced in his being
                        cleared from some part of his imputed guilt; —</span>

                        him; — she wished him happy.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03556" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.004.nar" data-placement="auto top">But the feelings of the past
                        could not be recalled. — Nothing could restore him with a faith
                        unbroken — a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing could do away
                        the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means, nor remove
                        the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. Nothing could replace him,
                        therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the interests of Colonel
                        Brandon.</span>

                        daughter, heard Willoughby's story from himself — had she witnessed
                        his distress, and been under the influence of his countenance and his
                        manner, it is probable that her compassion would have been greater. But it
                        was neither in Elinor's power, nor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in
                        another, by her retailed explanation, as had at first been called forth in
                        herself. Reflection had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own
                        opinion of Willoughby's deserts; — she wished, therefore, to declare
                        only the simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his
                        character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy
                        astray.</span>

                        were all three together, Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;
                        — but that it was not without an effort, the restless, unquiet
                        thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting
                        — her rising colour, as she spoke, — and her unsteady voice,

                            and a sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive,
                            as well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,
                            reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you
                            in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have
                            been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain.
                            Had you married, you must have been always poor. His expensiveness is
                            acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that
                            self-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His demands and your
                            inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought
                            on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having
                            been entirely unknown and unthought of before. YOUR sense of honour and
                            honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation, to
                            attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps,
                            as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort, you might
                            have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that — and how
                            little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin
                            which had begun before your marriage? — Beyond THAT, had you
                            endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to
                            be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent
                            to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart, and made
                            him regret the connection which had involved him in such
