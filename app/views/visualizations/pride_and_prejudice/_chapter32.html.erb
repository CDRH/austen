            <span id="said_no_02334" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
              while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.
              As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished
              letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,
              entered the room.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02335" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and</span>
            <span id="said_no_02336" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">apologised</span>
            <span id="said_no_02337" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top">for his intrusion</span>
            <span id="said_no_02338" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">by letting her know that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02339" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top">he had understood all the

            <span id="said_no_02340" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking
              into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when
              she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:
            </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02341" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have
              been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his
              sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02342" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“Perfectly so, I thank you.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_02343" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added: </span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02344" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I think I have understood that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02345" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.mersoc" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?” </span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02346" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of
              his time there in the future. He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02347" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
              neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not
              take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
              principle.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02348" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“I should not be surprised,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02349" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Darcy, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02350" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02351" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing
              else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02352" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">He took the hint, and soon began with, </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_02353" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to
              it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02354" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I believe she did — and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on
              a more grateful object.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02355" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02356" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few
              sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding — though I am not
              certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light
              it is certainly a very good match for her.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02357" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own
              family and friends.” </span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02358" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02359" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I
              call it a very easy distance.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02360" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match,” cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family.”
            </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02361" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very
              neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.” </span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02362" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">As he spoke there was a sort of smile</span>
            <span id="said_no_02363" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">which Elizabeth fancied she understood;</span>
            <span id="said_no_02364" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he must be supposing her to
              be thinking of Jane and Netherfield,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02365" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she blushed as she answered: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02366" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far
              and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant,
              distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one
              as will allow of frequent journeys — and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near  her family under less
              than half the present distance.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02367" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_02368" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.
                You cannot have been always at Longbourn.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02369" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his
              chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02370" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“Are you pleased with Kent?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02371" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise —
              and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tête à tête surprised them.
              Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to
              anybody, went away.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02372" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“What can be the meaning of this ?”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02373" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02374" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in
              this familiar way.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02375" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes,
              to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do,
              which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table,
              but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who
              lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning,
              sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came
              because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own
              satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02376" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">in comparing them, she saw</span>
            <span id="said_no_02377" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">there was less captivating
              softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02378" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she believed</span>
            <span id="said_no_02379" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he might have the best
              informed mind.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02380" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could
              not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of
              necessity rather than of choice — a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew
              not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own
              knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love
              her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to
              Hunsford; but without much success.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02381" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_char" data-placement="auto top">He certainly looked at her
              friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, stedfast gaze,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02382" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">but she often doubted</span>
            <span id="said_no_02383" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_char" data-placement="auto top">whether there were much
              admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02384" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but
              Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which
              might only end in disappointment;</span>
            <span id="said_no_02385" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">for in her opinion</span>

              would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02389" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel

              the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy
              had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all. </span>
