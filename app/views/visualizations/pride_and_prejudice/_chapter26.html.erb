            <span id="said_no_01988" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
              the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01989" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned
              against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour
              to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he
              is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not
              let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your
              resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.” </span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_01990" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01991" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.” </span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01992" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr.
              Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01993" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01994" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham;
              no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw — and if he becomes really attached to me
              — I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My
              father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In
              short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is
              affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be
              wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you,
              therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be
              wishing. In short, I will do my best.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01995" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At
              least, you should not remind  your mother of inviting him.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01997" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: </span>
            <span id="said_no_01998" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do
              not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as
              to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now, I
              hope you are satisfied.” </span>

          <span id="said_no_02002" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane;
            but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she
            was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she </span>
          <span id="said_no_02003" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“wished they might be happy.”</span>
          <span id="said_no_02004" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas as paid her farewell visit; and
            when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied
            her out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said: </span>

            <span id="said_no_02014" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and
              everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular
              and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02015" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that</span>

            <span id="said_no_02017" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been,
              rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she
              would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters
              were read,</span>

            <span id="said_no_02020" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not
              praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It
              was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know
              the rest. </span>

            <span id="said_no_02032" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my
              coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so
              much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
              not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_02036" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that
              she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and
              inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her
              manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.</span>
          
        </p>

        
          
            <p>
              
                <span id="said_no_02037" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better
                  judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though
                  the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as
                  natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
                  happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive
                  in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling
                  before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly
                  resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I
                  can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and
                  because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we
                  know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is
                  to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears
                  now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she
                  said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
                  cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of
                  duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy — your affection,
                  and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon.</span>

              required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.</span>

              subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02049" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without
              material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been
              his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom
              he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for
              his wish of independence.</span>

              could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and
              desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02052" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I
              really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are
              not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I
              am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though
              I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my
              comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.
              They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as
              well as the plain.” </span>
