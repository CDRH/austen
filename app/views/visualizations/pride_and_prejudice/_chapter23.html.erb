            <span id="said_no_01793" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she
              had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her
              engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded
              the matter — to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for</span>
            <span id="said_no_01794" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Bennet,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01795" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">with more perseverance than politeness,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01796" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">protested</span>
            <span id="said_no_01797" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">he must be entirely
              mistaken;</span>
            <span id="said_no_01798" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01799" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lydia Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr.
              Collins wants to marry Lizzy?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01800" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment;
              but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though</span>
            <span id="said_no_01801" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he</span>
            <span id="said_no_01802" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_sirl" data-placement="auto top">begged leave to be positive
              as to the truth of his information,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01803" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01804" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put
              herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the
              exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by
              making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient
              distance of Hunsford from London.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01805" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but
              no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01806" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">In the first place,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01807" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she persisted in</span>
            <span id="said_no_01808" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">disbelieving the whole of
              the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and
              fourthly, that the match might be broken off.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01809" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01810" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was the real cause
              of all the mischief;</span>
            <span id="said_no_01811" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and the other that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01812" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">she herself had been
              barbarously misused by them all;</span>
            <span id="said_no_01813" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console
              and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month
              passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive
              their daughter.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01814" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he
              pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for</span>
            <span id="said_no_01815" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrb" data-placement="auto top">it gratified him,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01816" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he said,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01817" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrb" data-placement="auto top">to discover that Charlotte
              Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01818" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Jane confessed herself</span>
            <span id="said_no_01819" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_jane" data-placement="auto top">a little surprised at the
              match;</span>
            <span id="said_no_01820" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could
              Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and
              it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01821" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort
              of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks
              and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01822" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the
              subject; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_01823" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth felt persuaded that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01824" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">no real confidence could
              ever subsist between them again.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01825" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose
              rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now
              been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01826" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might
              reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all
              the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01827" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he proceeded to inform them,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01828" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">with many rapturous expressions,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01829" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_coll" data-placement="auto top">of his happiness in having
              obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01830" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>
            <span id="said_no_01831" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">then explained that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01832" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_coll" data-placement="auto top">it was merely with the view
              of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to
              return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01833" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he added,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01834" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_coll" data-placement="auto top">so heartily approved his
              marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to
              name an early day for making him the happiest of men.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01835" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On
              the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01836" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">It was very strange that he
              should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the
              house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01837" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of
              Mr. Bingley's continued absence.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01838" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without
              bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a
              report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01839" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Even</span>
            <span id="said_no_01840" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth began to fear</span>
            <span id="said_no_01841" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">— not that Bingley was indifferent — but</span>
            <span id="said_no_01842" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01843" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">his sisters would be
              successful in keeping him away.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01844" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to
              the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01845" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">The united efforts of his
              two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too
              much,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01846" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she feared,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01847" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">for the strength of his
              attachment.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01848" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful
              than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never
              alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained</span>
            <span id="said_no_01849" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">her mother,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01850" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his
              arrival, or</span>
            <span id="said_no_01851" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">even require Jane to confess that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01852" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">if he did not come back she
              would think herself very ill used.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01853" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01854" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not
              quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the
              business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes
              returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01855" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Bennet</span>
            <span id="said_no_01856" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her
              into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her
              successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the
              hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01857" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">was convinced that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01858" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">they were talking of the
              Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01859" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01860" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_01861" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said she, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01862" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress
              of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!”
            </span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01863" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let

            <span id="said_no_01864" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she
              went on as before. </span>

            <span id="said_no_01865" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
