              in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.</span>

              way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.</span>

            <span id="said_no_04461" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously
              expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly
              watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother,
              occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round,
              and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04462" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble
              indifference, and</span>
            <span id="said_no_04463" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she would have imagined that</span>

            <span id="said_no_04466" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> his eyes likewise turned
              towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04467" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her, which,
              though more guarded than formerly,</span>
            <span id="said_no_04468" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">persuaded Elizabeth, that</span>
            <span id="said_no_04469" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> if left wholly to himself,
              Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04470" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his
              behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as
              the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04471" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She knew</span>
            <span id="said_no_04472" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> how little such a
              situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04473" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke
              to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more
              painful to Elizabeth's mind; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_04474" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to</span>

              was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.</span>

            <span id="said_no_04476" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was in hopes that</span>
            <span id="said_no_04477" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> the evening would afford
              some opportunity of bringing them together;</span>
            <span id="said_no_04478" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">that</span>

              would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his
              entrance.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04480" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was
              wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure
              for the evening must depend.</span>
          
        </p>

              have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,</span>
            <span id="said_no_04487" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a
              confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved
              closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_04488" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Unknown girl" data-placement="auto top">“The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?”
            </span>

            <span id="said_no_04489" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied
              everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!
            </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04490" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a
              renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no
              indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!” </span>

            <span id="said_no_04491" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized
              the opportunity of saying: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04492" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Is your sister at Pemberley still?” </span>

            <span id="said_no_04496" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have
              better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked
              away.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>

              whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for
              the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him
              play as unsuccessfully as herself.</span>
