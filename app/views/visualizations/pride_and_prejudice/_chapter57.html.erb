              his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her  being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when

                that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future

            <span id="said_no_04806" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> In that case he would
