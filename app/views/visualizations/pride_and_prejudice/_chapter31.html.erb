            <span id="said_no_02274" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and
              the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
              received any invitation thither — for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
              almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
              come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at
              the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02275" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady
              Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could
              get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person
              in the room.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02276" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at
              Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent
              and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room
              before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while shared
              the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out: </span>

            <span id="said_no_02277" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Catherine de Bourgh" data-placement="auto top">“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are
              you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.” </span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_02278" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Colonel Fitzwilliam" data-placement="auto top">“We are speaking of music, madam,”</span>
          
          <span id="said_no_02279" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02280" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Catherine de Bourgh" data-placement="auto top">“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my
              share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than
              myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her
              to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?” </span>

            <span id="said_no_02283" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Lady Catherine; </span>
            <span id="said_no_02284" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Catherine de Bourgh" data-placement="auto top">“and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice
              a good deal.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_02285" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Colonel Fitzwilliam" data-placement="auto top">“I assure you, madam,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02286" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> he replied, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02287" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Colonel Fitzwilliam" data-placement="auto top">“that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly.” </span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02288" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Catherine de Bourgh" data-placement="auto top">“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I
              shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant
              practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no
              instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She
              would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house.” </span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_02293" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened
              to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation
              towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at
              the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said: </span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_02294" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? But I
              will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be
              frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_02296" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> he replied, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02297" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and

              are not your own.” </span>

          <span id="said_no_02298" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, </span>

              word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped
              to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in
              Hertfordshire — and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too — for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as
              will shock your relations to hear.” </span>

              first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball — and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only
              four dances! I am sorry to pain you — but so it was. He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
              more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.” </span>
