              opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received
              orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in
              the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.</span>

            <span id="said_no_04302" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). </span>
            <span id="said_no_04303" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is
              nothing to us, you know, and I am sure  I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to
              Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago
              never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?” </span>

            <span id="said_no_04305" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied the other, </span>
            <span id="said_no_04306" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Phillips" data-placement="auto top">“for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out
              myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on
              Wednesday. She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some more meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks
              just fit to be killed.” </span>

          <span id="said_no_04308" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
            Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said: </span>

              I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing,
              that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people's
              remarks.” </span>

              intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she
