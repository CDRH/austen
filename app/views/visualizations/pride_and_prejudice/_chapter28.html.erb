            <span id="said_no_02092" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
              Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the
              prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02093" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage,
              and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection
              of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02094" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in
              it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the
              carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they
              were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was
              more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not
              altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his
              inquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and
              as soon as they were in the parlour,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02095" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he welcomed them</span>
            <span id="said_no_02096" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">a second time, with ostentatious formality</span>
            <span id="said_no_02097" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_coll" data-placement="auto top">to his humble abode,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02098" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02099" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_02100" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could not help in fancying that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02101" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">in displaying the good
              proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost
              in refusing him.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02102" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh
              of repentance, and rather</span>
            <span id="said_no_02103" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">looked with wonder at her friend that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02104" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">she could have so cheerful
              an air with such a companion.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02105" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly
              was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely
              did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of
              their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out,
              and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the
              command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here,
              leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was
              pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees
              there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be
              compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a
              handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02106" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not
              having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend
              over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help. It was rather small, but well
              built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.
              When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02107" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth supposed</span>
            <span id="said_no_02108" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he must be often
              forgotten.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02109" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again
              while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02110" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on
              the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you
              will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my
              sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at
              Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should
              say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02111" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02112" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> added Charlotte, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02113" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“and a most attentive neighbour.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02114" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one
              cannot regard with too much deference.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02115" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had
              already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to
              understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to
              anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of
              their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02116" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden
              noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry,
              and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out— </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02117" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such
              a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02118" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the
              dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02119" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“And is this all?”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02120" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried Elizabeth.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02121" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but
              Lady Catherine and her daughter.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02122" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“La! my dear,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02123" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02124" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the
              other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02125" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she
              not come in?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02126" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“Oh,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02127" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Lucas" data-placement="auto top">Charlotte says</span>
            <span id="said_no_02128" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.marl_char" data-placement="auto top">she hardly ever does. It
              is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02129" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I like her appearance,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02130" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02131" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a
              very proper wife.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02132" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and
              Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly
              bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02133" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into
              the house.</span>
