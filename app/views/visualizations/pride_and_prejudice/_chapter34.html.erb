            <span id="said_no_02502" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
              much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in
              Kent.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02503" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">They contained no actual
              complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each,
              there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease
              with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02504" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it
              had hardly received on the first perusal.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02505" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Darcy's shameful boast
              of what misery he had been able to inflict,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02506" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02507" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was some consolation to think that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02508" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">his visit to Rosings was to
              end on the day after the next</span>
            <span id="said_no_02509" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">— and,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02510" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">a still greater, that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02511" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">in less than a fortnight
              she should herself be with Jane again, , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02512" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with
              him; but</span>
            <span id="said_no_02513" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">Colonel Fitzwilliam had
              made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02514" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her
              spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might
              now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter
              amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02515" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">imputing his visit to</span>
            <span id="said_no_02516" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top">a wish of hearing that she
              were better.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02517" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked
              about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and
              thus began:</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02518" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You
              must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02519" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.
              This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well;
              but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His
              sense of</span>
            <span id="said_no_02520" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top">her inferiority — of its
              being a degradation — of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02521" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">were dwelt on with a warmth</span>
            <span id="said_no_02522" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
              suit. </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02523" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a
            man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to
            resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he
            should have done.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02524" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">He concluded with representing to her</span>
          <span id="said_no_02525" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top">the strength of that attachment
            which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer;</span>
          <span id="said_no_02526" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and with expressing his hope that</span>
          <span id="said_no_02527" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top">it would now be rewarded by her
            acceptance of his hand.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02528" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">As he said this,</span>
          <span id="said_no_02529" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could easily see that</span>
          <span id="said_no_02530" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he had no doubt of a
            favourable answer.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02531" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">He spoke
            of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02532" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
            cheeks, and she said: </span>
          <br></br>
          
            <span id="said_no_02533" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of
              obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot — I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
              bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of
              short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
              it after this explanation.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02534" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantlepiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to
            catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every
            feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was
            to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02535" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said, </span>
          <br></br>
          
            <span id="said_no_02536" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might,
              perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”
            </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02537" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I might as well inquire,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied she, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02539" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me
              that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided against you — had they been
              indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of
              ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?” </span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02540" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he
              listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued:</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02541" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the
              unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only
              means of dividing them from each other — of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its
              derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02542" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved
              him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02543" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Can you deny that you have done it?”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02544" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she repeated.</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02545" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With assumed tranquillity he then replied: </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_02546" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend
              from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02547" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not
              escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02548" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“But it is not merely this affair,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02549" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she continued, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02550" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
              decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say?
              In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02551" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,”</span>
          
          <span id="said_no_02552" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02553" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?”
            </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02554" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“His misfortunes!”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02555" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> repeated Darcy contemptuously; </span>
            <span id="said_no_02556" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02557" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“And of your infliction,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02558" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried Elizabeth with energy.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02559" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“You have reduced him to his present state of poverty — comparative poverty.
              You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that
              independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt
              and ridicule.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02560" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“And this,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02561" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02562" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for
              explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in his walk, and turning
              towards her, “these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long
              prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles,
              and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But
              disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in
              the inferiority of your connections? — to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my
              own?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02563" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak
              with composure when she said: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02564" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration
              affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike
              manner.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02565" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued: </span>
          
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02566" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would

        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02567" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled
              incredulity and mortification. She went on:</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>

              my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
              feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had
              not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.” </span>
