              Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and
              concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question
              the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
              interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
              throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01267" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said she, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01268" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.
              Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances
              which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01269" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the
              interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
              somebody.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01270" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest
              Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, one, whom his
              father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of
              it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01271" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham
              should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr.
              Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01272" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“It is difficult indeed — it is distressing. One does not know what to think.”

            <span id="said_no_01273" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01274" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But</span>
            <span id="said_no_01275" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Jane could think with certainty on only one point — that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01276" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_jane" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01277" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the
              arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the
              long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01278" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The two ladies</span>
            <span id="said_no_01279" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">were delighted to see their dear friend again,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01280" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">called it</span>
            <span id="said_no_01281" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msbmrsh" data-placement="auto top">an age since they had
              met,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01282" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>
            <span id="said_no_01283" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">repeatedly asked</span>
            <span id="said_no_01284" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msbmrsh" data-placement="auto top">what she had been
              doing with herself since their separation.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01285" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible,
              saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took
              their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01286" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs.
              Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr.
              Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of
              their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr.
              Darcy's look and behavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for
              though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them,
              and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even</span>
            <span id="said_no_01287" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mary could assure her family that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01288" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mary" data-placement="auto top">she had no disinclination
              for it.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01289" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough — I think it
              is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider
              intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01290" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak
              unnecessarily to Mr. Collins,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01291" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could not help asking him</span>
            <span id="said_no_01292" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">whether he intended to
              accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement;</span>
            <span id="said_no_01293" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and
              was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance. </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01294" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_01295" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said he, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01296" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">“that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
              can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
              cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a
              preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01297" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham
              for those very dances; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_01298" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">to have Mr. Collins
              instead!</span>
            <span id="said_no_01299" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham's
              happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not
              the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01300" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It now first struck her, that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01301" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">she
              was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings,
              in the absence of more eligible visitors.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01302" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself,
              and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her
              charms, it was not long before</span>
            <span id="said_no_01303" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">her mother gave her to understand that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01304" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">the probability of their
              marriage was extremely agreeable to her.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01305" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute
              must be the consequence of any reply.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01306" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Collins might never
              make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01307" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets
              would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of
              rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after — the very shoe-roses for Netherfield
              were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her
              acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to
              Kitty and Lydia.</span>
