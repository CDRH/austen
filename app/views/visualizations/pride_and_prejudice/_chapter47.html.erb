            <span id="said_no_03646" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said her uncle, as they drove from the town; </span>
            <span id="said_no_03647" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge
              as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by
              no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he
              expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His
              temptation is not adequate to the risk!” </span>

            <span id="said_no_03650" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“Upon my word,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_03651" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Mrs. Gardiner, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03652" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“I begin to be of your uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of
              decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up,
              as to believe him capable of it?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03653" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can
              believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?”
            </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03654" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“In the first place,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_03655" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied Mr. Gardiner, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03656" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03657" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption!
              And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03658" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“Well, then — supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the
              purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike
              them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03659" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be
              private? Oh! no, no — this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to
              marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia — what attraction has she
              beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
              restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing
              of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step
              forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was
              going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a
              matter.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03660" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent
              to live with him on any terms other than marriage?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03661" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with tears in her
              eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not
              doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a
              twelvemonth — she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and
              frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
              flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater
              — what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
              person and address that can captivate a woman.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03662" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“But you see that Jane,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_03663" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said her aunt, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03664" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”
            </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03665" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former
              conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really
              is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and
              deceitful as he is insinuating.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03666" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“And do you really know all this?”</span>
          
          <span id="said_no_03667" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03668" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I do indeed,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_03669" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied Elizabeth, colouring.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03670" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself,
              when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are
              other circumstances which I am not at liberty — which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are
              endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary
              himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03671" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem
              so well to understand?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03672" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Oh, yes! — that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much
              both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire was
              to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to
              make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should
              then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never
              occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03673" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to
              believe them fond of each other?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03674" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Not the slightest. I can remember no sympton of affection on either side; and had
              anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the
              corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two
              months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant
              and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”

              and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the
              journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of

              their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however,
              were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself
              incurred in this business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of

            impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, </span>

              first got abroad, it hastened his journey.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_03738" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Yes; but, when questioned by him Denny denied knowing anything
              of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying — and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.” </span>

              uneasy — a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My
              father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing
              more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with
              each other, many weeks.” </span>

              sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not
              be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She
              was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered
              her services, or any of her daughters', if they should be of use to us.” </span>

              if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from ’ Clapham.
              It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another
              might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
              determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other
              designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out
              even so much as this.” </span>
