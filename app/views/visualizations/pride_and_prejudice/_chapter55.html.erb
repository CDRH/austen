            <span id="said_no_04533" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
              friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good
              spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern,</span>
            <span id="said_no_04534" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he confessed himself</span>

            <span id="said_no_04537" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said she, </span>
            <span id="said_no_04538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I hope we shall be more lucky.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_04539" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_bing" data-placement="auto top">He should be particularly
              happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.</span>

            <span id="said_no_04541" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_bing" data-placement="auto top"> Yes, he had no engagement at
              all for to-morrow;</span>
            <span id="said_no_04542" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.</span>

          <span id="said_no_04543" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet
            to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out: </span>
          <br></br>
          
            <span id="said_no_04544" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come — Mr. Bingley
              is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
              Lizzy's hair.” </span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04552" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet
            retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04553" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top"> Two obstacles of the five

            making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_04555" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Kitty Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”

            <span id="said_no_04557" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
              suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, </span>

            <span id="said_no_04558" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,”</span>
          
          <span id="said_no_04559" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at
            such premeditation, and</span>
          <span id="said_no_04560" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">her entreaty that</span>

            she would not give in to it.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04562" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out: </span>

            <span id="said_no_04566" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04567" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_04568" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she
              and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04569" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04570" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">Bingley was every thing
              that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04571" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he
              bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly
              grateful to the daughter.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04572" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was
              formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_04573" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters
              concerning Bingley; </span>
            <span id="said_no_04574" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that</span>
            <span id="said_no_04575" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> all must speedily be
              concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04576" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that</span>
            <span id="said_no_04577" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> all this must have taken
              place with that gentleman's concurrence.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04578" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as
              had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that
              could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him.
              Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and
              her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going
              to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04579" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,</span>
            <span id="said_no_04580" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she saw, to her infinite surprise,</span>
            <span id="said_no_04581" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> there was reason to fear
              that her mother had been too ingenious for her.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04582" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as
              if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each
              other, would have told it all.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04583" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">
              Their situation was awkward enough; but hers</span>
            <span id="said_no_04584" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she thought</span>
            <span id="said_no_04585" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> was still worse.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04586" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when
              Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04587" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Jane</span>
            <span id="said_no_04588" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly
              embracing her, </span>
            <span id="said_no_04589" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that</span>
            <span id="said_no_04590" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_jane" data-placement="auto top"> she was the happiest
              creature in the world.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04591" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“'Tis too much!”</span>
            <span id="said_no_04592" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she added, </span>
            <span id="said_no_04593" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?"</span>

            <span id="said_no_04594" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could
              but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister,
              or say half that remained to be said for the present.</span>

            <span id="said_no_04595" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I must go instantly to my mother;”</span>
            <span id="said_no_04596" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she cried.</span>
            <span id="said_no_04597" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to
              hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my
              dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!” </span>

            <span id="said_no_04598" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was
