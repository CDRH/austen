        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04046" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
              probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
              arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04047" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the
              face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04048" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.
              Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his
              lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04049" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His
              countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke
              him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned
              from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some
              little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_04050" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing,
              that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would
              have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, </span>
            <span id="said_no_04051" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">resolving within herself</span>

            <span id="said_no_04053" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their
              confusion suffered no variation of colour.</span>

            <span id="said_no_04054" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough;
              and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease </span>
            <span id="said_no_04055" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">which she felt</span>

            <span id="said_no_04060" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she cried, </span>

              things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though
              I thought it would be very good fun if I was.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04062" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but
            she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_04063" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lydia Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they
              might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him,
              and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”
            </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04064" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till
            she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her
            mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_04065" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lydia Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married
              woman.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_04066" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been
              so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to
              hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to
              Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.</span>

            <span id="said_no_04069" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lydia Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters
              must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is,
              mamma, we did not all go.” </span>

              take care to get good partners for them all.” </span>

              know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle
              and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so
              afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I
              was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking,
              you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat."</span>

              by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not
              once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but,
              however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid
              man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my
              uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time,
              and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put
