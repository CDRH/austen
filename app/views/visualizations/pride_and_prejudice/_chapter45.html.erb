              her had originated in jealousy,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03488" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could not help feeling</span>
            <span id="said_no_03489" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> how very unwelcome her
              appearance at Pemberley must be to her,</span>

            <span id="said_no_03492" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> with how much civility on
              that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03493" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect
              rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house,
              and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03494" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss
              Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which,
              though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud
              and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03495" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated,
              a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking
              woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and
              Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join
              in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03496" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth soon saw that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03497" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> she was herself closely
              watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03498" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not
              been seated at an inconvenient distance; but</span>
            <span id="said_no_03499" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she was not sorry</span>
            <span id="said_no_03500" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> to be spared the necessity
              of saying much.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03501" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her own thoughts were employing her.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03502" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She expected every moment that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03503" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> some of the gentlemen
              would enter the room.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03504" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She wished, she feared that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03505" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> the master of the house
              might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03506" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice,
              Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and
              the other said no more.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03507" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold
              meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.
              Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party — for though they could not
              all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03508" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding</span>
            <span id="said_no_03509" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> whether she most feared or
              wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03510" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and then, though</span>
            <span id="said_no_03511" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">but a moment before she had believed</span>
            <span id="said_no_03512" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> her wishes to
              predominate,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03513" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she began to regret that he came.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03514" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house,
              was engaged by the river, and had left him</span>
            <span id="said_no_03515" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">only on learning that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03516" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top"> the ladies of the family
              intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03517" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved</span>
            <span id="said_no_03518" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> to be perfectly easy and
              unembarrassed; </span>
            <span id="said_no_03519" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03520" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">because she saw that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03521" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> the suspicions of the
              whole party were awakened against them,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03522" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03523" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> there was scarcely an eye
              which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03524" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of
              the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to
              Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and</span>
            <span id="said_no_03525" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth saw that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03526" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> he was anxious for his
              sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03527" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity
              of saying, with sneering civility: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03528" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton? They
              must be a great loss to your family.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03529" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but </span>
            <span id="said_no_03530" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth instantly comprehended that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03531" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> he was uppermost in her
              thoughts;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03532" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting
              herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an
              involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to
              lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but
              she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a
              sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of
              her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no creature had it been
              revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it,
              from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and
              without meaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively
              concern for the welfare of his friend.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03533" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed
              and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her
              brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn
              his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03534" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr.
              Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But
              Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such
              terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon,
              Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03535" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_03536" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she cried; </span>
            <span id="said_no_03537" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is
              grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03539" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he contented himself with coolly replying that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03540" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top"> he perceived no other
              alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03541" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“For my own part,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_03542" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she rejoined, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03543" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her
              complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character — there is nothing marked in its lines. Her
              teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
              extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without
              fashion, which is intolerable.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03544" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of
              recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.
              He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued: </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03545" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find
              that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, 'She a beauty! — I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her
              rather pretty at one time.”</span>
          
          
            <span id="said_no_03546" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“Yes,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_03547" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03548" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months
              since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03549" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say
              what gave no one any pain but herself.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03550" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they
              returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the
              person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit — of everything but himself; yet
              Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the
              subject.</span>
