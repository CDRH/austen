            <span id="said_no_03402" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
              her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_03403" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">was consequently resolved</span>
            <span id="said_no_03404" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">not to be out of sight of
              the inn the whole of that morning.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03405" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these
              visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for
              dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the
              street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations
              by</span>
            <span id="said_no_03406" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">acquainting them</span>
            <span id="said_no_03407" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">with the honour which she
              expected.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03408" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined
              to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever
              suggested it before, but</span>
            <span id="said_no_03409" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">they now felt that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03410" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrgmrsg" data-placement="auto top">there was no other
              way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03411" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's
              feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet</span>
            <span id="said_no_03412" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she dreaded</span>
            <span id="said_no_03413" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">lest the partiality of the
              brother should have said too much in her favour;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03414" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and, more than commonly anxious to please,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03415" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she naturally suspected that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03416" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">every power of pleasing
              would fail her.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03417" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room,
              endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03418" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03419" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With astonishment did Elizabeth see that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03420" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">her new acquaintance was at
              least as much embarrassed as herself.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03421" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Since her being at Lambton,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03422" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she had heard that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03423" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_lambsoc" data-placement="auto top">Miss Darcy was
              exceedingly proud;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03424" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She
              found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03425" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen,
              her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her
              face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as
              ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03426" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">They had not long been together before</span>
            <span id="said_no_03427" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Darcy told her that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03428" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top">Bingley was also coming to
              wait on her;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03429" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when
              Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but
              had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her
              again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
              done.</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03430" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had
              long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and
              their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries</span>
            <span id="said_no_03431" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">the full conviction that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03432" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrgmrsg" data-placement="auto top">one of them at least
              knew what it was to love.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03433" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but</span>
            <span id="said_no_03434" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03435" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrgmrsg" data-placement="auto top">the gentleman was
              overflowing with admiration was evident enough.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03436" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her
              visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was
              most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager,
              and Darcy determined, to be pleased. </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03437" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she long
            to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes</span>
          <span id="said_no_03438" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could fancy that</span>
          <span id="said_no_03439" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he talked less than on former
            occasions,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03440" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>
          <span id="said_no_03441" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">once or twice pleased herself with the notion that,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03442" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">as he looked at her,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03443" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he was trying to trace a
            resemblance.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03444" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy,
            who had been set up as a rival to Jane.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03445" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">No look appeared on either
            side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03446" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
            parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection </span>
          <span id="said_no_03447" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of
            her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it
            “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply, he added, </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_03448" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were
              all dancing together at Netherfield.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03449" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_03450" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he afterwards took occasion to ask her,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03451" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">when unattended to by any of the rest,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03452" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_bing" data-placement="auto top">whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03453" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a
              manner which gave them meaning.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03454" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch
              a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of
              his companions, as</span>
            <span id="said_no_03455" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">convinced her that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03456" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">the improvement of manners
              which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the
              acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace — when she saw
              him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03457" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage — the difference, the change
              was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03458" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">Never, even in the company
              of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence
              or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom
              his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03459" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour, and when they arose to depart,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03460" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing</span>
            <span id="said_no_03461" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top">their wish of seeing Mr. and
              Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03462" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
              readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt
              disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary
              embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she
              ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03463" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Bingley expressed</span>
            <span id="said_no_03464" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_bing" data-placement="auto top">great pleasure in the
              certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire
              friends.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03465" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and
              on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
              satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
              uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03466" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force
              her communication.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03467" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was evident that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03468" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrgmrsg" data-placement="auto top">she was much better
              acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03469" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03470" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance
              reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and
              his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it
              for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and</span>
            <span id="said_no_03471" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">they soon became sensible that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03472" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrgmrsg" data-placement="auto top">the authority of a
              servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03473" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially
              lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride;</span>

              had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03476" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_lambsoc" data-placement="auto top">he was a liberal man,

              estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his
              quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03478" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the
              evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and
              she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03479" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">She certainly did not hate
              him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so
              called.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03480" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly
              admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the
              testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above
              respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03481" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> gratitude, not merely for
              having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
              unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental
              meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two
              selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of
              so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude — for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on
              her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was
              grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and
              how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her
              renewal of his addresses.</span>

              civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought
              to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly
