            <span id="said_no_00609" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
              morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
              and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however,</span>
            <span id="said_no_00610" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she requested</span>
            <span id="said_no_00611" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> to have a note sent to
              Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00612" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet,
              accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00613" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being
              satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would
              probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the
              apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and
              invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found
              Miss Bennet worse than she expected.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00614" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Indeed I have, sir,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00615" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> was her answer.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00616" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not
              think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.”</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00617" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“Removed!”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00618" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried Bingley.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00619" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.”

            <span id="said_no_00621" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, </span>

            <span id="said_no_00623" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00626" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of
              her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for
              she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her.
              You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to
              Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00627" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00628" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied he; </span>
            <span id="said_no_00629" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in
              five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00630" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,”</span>

          <span id="said_no_00633" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried he, turning towards her.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00636" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate
              character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”</span>

            <span id="said_no_00641" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> continued Bingley immediately, </span>
            <span id="said_no_00642" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_00643" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have
              at least that advantage.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_00649" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00650" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“I assure you there is quite as much of that going

            <span id="said_no_00651" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.
              Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00661" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of

        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00662" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
              many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.” </span>

              anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
              Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did
              not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.” </span>

              also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon
              afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each
              other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that</span>

              countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of
              natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had
              increased into assurance.</span>
