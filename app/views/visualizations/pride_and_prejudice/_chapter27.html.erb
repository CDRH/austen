            <span id="said_no_02053" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
              diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
              Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and
              she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
              Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable
              sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and,
              in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled
              according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was
              added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be. </span>

            <span id="said_no_02054" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to
              the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter. </span>

            <span id="said_no_02055" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His
              present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to
              pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in
              Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and</span>
            <span id="said_no_02056" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_wick" data-placement="auto top">trusting their opinion of
              her — their opinion of everybody — would always coincide,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02057" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">there was a solicitude, an

            <span id="said_no_02058" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">which she felt</span>
            <span id="said_no_02059" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">must ever attach her to him
              with a most sincere regard;</span>
            <span id="said_no_02060" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>
            <span id="said_no_02061" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she parted from him convinced that,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02062" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">whether married or single,
              he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02063" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir
              William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and
              were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He
              could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02064" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch
              Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she
              was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a
              troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness,
              as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the
              morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02065" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her sister; and she was more
              grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of
              dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's
              visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had,
              from her heart, given up the acquaintance. </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02066" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it
              so well.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02067" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“But my dear Elizabeth,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02068" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she added, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02069" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”

            <span id="said_no_02070" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the
              mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it
              would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02071" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to
              think.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02072" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02073" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death made her
              mistress of this fortune.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02074" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“No — why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was
              equally poor?” </span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02075" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after
              this event.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02076" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which
              other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why should we?” </span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_02077" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“Her not objecting does not justify him.
              It only shows her being deficient in something herself — sense or feeling.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02078" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Well,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02079" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried Elizabeth, </span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02081" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry,
              you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_02082" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire;
              and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall
              find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after
              all.” </span>

              disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will
              know where we have gone — we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled
              together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.” </span>
