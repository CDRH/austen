              Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much
              superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00468" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> Jane was by no means
              better.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00469" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The sisters,</span>
            <span id="said_no_00470" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">on hearing this,</span>

              grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold,</span>
            <span id="said_no_00473" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>
            <span id="said_no_00474" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msbmrsh" data-placement="auto top"> how excessively they

            <span id="said_no_00475" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately
              before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00476" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.
              His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she
              believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister
              scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who when
              he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00477" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon
              as she was out of the room.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00478" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msb" data-placement="auto top"> Her manners were</span>
            <span id="said_no_00479" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">pronounced to be</span>
            <span id="said_no_00480" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msb" data-placement="auto top"> very bad indeed, a mixture of
              pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00481" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00482" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Hurst" data-placement="auto top">“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall
              never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.”</span>

            <span id="said_no_00483" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to
              come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”
            </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00484" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Hurst" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am
              absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.”</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00487" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
              well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00488" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,”</span>

              sister make such an exhibition.” </span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00491" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“Certainly not.”</span>

            <span id="said_no_00492" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her
              ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most
              country-town indifference to decorum.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00493" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” </span>

            <span id="said_no_00495" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00496" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, </span>
            <span id="said_no_00497" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_00498" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“Not at all,”</span>

          <span id="said_no_00501" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">— A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:</span>

            <span id="said_no_00502" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Hurst" data-placement="auto top">“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl,
              and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of
              it.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00503" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_00504" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Hurst" data-placement="auto top">“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_00510" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration

              their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.</span>
          
        </p>

              and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she
              had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the
              drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high</span>
