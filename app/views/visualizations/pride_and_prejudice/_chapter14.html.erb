            <span id="said_no_00985" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some
              conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by</span>
            <span id="said_no_00986" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">observing that</span>

              his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00988" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject
              elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect</span>
            <span id="said_no_00989" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he protested that</span>
            <span id="said_no_00990" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">"he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank — such affability
              and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which
              he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday
              before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had
              never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection
              to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had
              even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble
              parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself — some
              shelves in the closet upstairs.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00993" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great
              ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01002" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.coll_deb" data-placement="auto top">in point of true beauty,
              Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished
              birth.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01003" class="said indirect said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.coll_jenk" data-placement="auto top">She is unfortunately of a
              sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed
              of,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01004" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">as</span>
            <span id="said_no_01005" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">I am informed by the lady who superintended her education,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01006" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by
              my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”</span>

            <span id="said_no_01008" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that
              means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the
              idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I
              have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead
              of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention
              which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01011" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May
              I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?”</span>

            <span id="said_no_01012" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse
              myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as
              unstudied an air as possible.”</span>

            <span id="said_no_01013" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he
              listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional
              glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01016" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01017" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">glad to invite him</span>

              be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01021" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">protested that</span>

            <span id="said_no_01023" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
              he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
              interrupted him with:</span>

              aside his book, and said:</span>

            <span id="said_no_01029" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top">“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious
              stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as
              instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.” </span>
