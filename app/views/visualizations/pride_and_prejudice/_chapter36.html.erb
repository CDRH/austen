        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02601" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
              contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
              she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02602" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With amazement did she first understand that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02603" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he believed any apology to
              be in his power;</span>
            <span id="said_no_02604" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>
            <span id="said_no_02605" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">steadfastly was she persuaded, that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02606" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he could have no
              explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02607" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had
              happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next
              sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly
              resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He
              expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02608" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham — when she read with
              somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an
              affinity to his own history of himself — her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment,
              apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02609" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02610" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">— and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
              last page or two, put it hastily away,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02611" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">protesting that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02612" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">she would not regard
              it,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02613" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">that she</span>
            <span id="said_no_02614" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">would never look in it
              again.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02615" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it
              would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal
              of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02616" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">The account of his
              connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02617" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">though she had not before known its extent,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02618" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> agreed equally well with
              his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other;</span>
            <span id="said_no_02619" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was
              fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02620" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">it was impossible not to feel that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02621" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">there was gross duplicity
              on one side or the other;</span>
            <span id="said_no_02622" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and, for a few moments,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02623" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she flattered herself that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02624" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">her wishes did not
              err.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02625" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following
              of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she
              forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality — deliberated on the
              probability of each statement — but with little success.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02626" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">On both sides it was only
              assertion.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02627" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02628" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as</span>
            <span id="said_no_02629" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it</span>
            <span id="said_no_02630" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">less than infamous,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02631" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02632" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">The extravagance and
              general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's charge,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02633" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">exceedingly shocked her;</span>
            <span id="said_no_02634" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02635" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">She had never heard of him
              before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him
              accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told
              himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02636" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">His countenance, voice, and
              manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02637" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or
              benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under
              which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But no such recollection
              befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than
              the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a
              considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation
              from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every
              particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself — from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's
              affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by
              the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished</span>
            <span id="said_no_02638" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">by the conviction that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02639" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Darcy would never have
              hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02640" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself,
              in their first evening at Mr . Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02641" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was now struck with</span>
            <span id="said_no_02642" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">the impropriety of such
              communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02643" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his
              professions with his conduct.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02644" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She remembered that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02645" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">he had boasted of having no
              fear of seeing Mr. Darcy — that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had
              avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02646" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She remembered also that,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02647" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">till the Netherfield family
              had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had
              then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his
              exposing the son.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02648" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King
              were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes,
              but</span>
            <span id="said_no_02649" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">his eagerness to grasp at
              anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been
              gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which</span>
            <span id="said_no_02650" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she believed</span>
            <span id="said_no_02651" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">she had most incautiously
              shown.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02652" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of
              Mr. Darcy,</span>
            <span id="said_no_02653" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could not but allow that</span>
            <span id="said_no_02654" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Bingley, when
              questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the
              whole course of their acquaintance — an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with
              his ways — seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust — anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;
              that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued — that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often
              heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been
              what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship
              between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02655" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without
              feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02656" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“How despicably I have acted!”</span>
            <span id="said_no_02657" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she cried;</span>
            <span id="said_no_02658" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my
              abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating
              is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
              folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
              prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_02659" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">From herself to Jane — from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon</span>
            <span id="said_no_02660" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">brought to her recollection that</span>

            <span id="said_no_02662" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.</span>
            <span id="said_no_02663" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">How could she deny that

            <span id="said_no_02669" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">there was a constant

            <span id="said_no_02670" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such
              mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the
              circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not
              have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
