            <span id="said_no_03041" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not
              have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of
              good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their
              marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness
              were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of
              those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these
              tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to
              his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are
              wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03042" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a
              husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured
              to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing
              his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But</span>
            <span id="said_no_03043" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she had never felt so strongly as now</span>
            <span id="said_no_03044" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">the disadvantages which
              must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03045" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">nor ever been so fully aware of</span>
            <span id="said_no_03046" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">the evils arising from so
              ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if
              incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03047" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little other cause for
              satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose
              constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03048" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">though Kitty might in time
              regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be
              apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03049" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to
              which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was
              consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity — to have some other point on which her wishes and
              hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.
              Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the
              discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been
              perfect.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03050" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“But it is fortunate,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_03051" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> thought she, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03052" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my
              disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to
              have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment
              is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03053" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty;
              but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else, than that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03054" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_lyd" data-placement="auto top">they were just returned from
              the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had
              a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called
              her, and they were going off to the camp;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03055" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt — for her
              letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03056" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness
              began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer
              finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much
              recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as</span>
            <span id="said_no_03057" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">to make Elizabeth hope that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03058" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">by the following Christmas
              she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War
              Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03059" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a
              fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its
              extent.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03060" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsg" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Gardiner would be
              prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a
              period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they
              were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards
              than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03061" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly
              passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated
              beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03062" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth</span>
            <span id="said_no_03063" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and</span>
            <span id="said_no_03064" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">still thought</span>
            <span id="said_no_03065" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">there might have been time
              enough.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03066" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But it was her business to be satisfied — and certainly her temper to be happy; and all
              was soon right again.</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03067" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see
            the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.</span>
          
            <span id="said_no_03068" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“But surely,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_03069" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said she, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03070" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without
              his perceiving me.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03071" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and
              aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two
              girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general
              favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way — teaching them, playing
              with them, and loving them.</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03072" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in
              pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain — that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health
              and temper to bear inconveniences — cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure — and affection and intelligence, which might supply it
              among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_03073" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the
              remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small
              part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had
              lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and
              within five miles of Lambton,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03074" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth found from her aunt that</span>

              was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03076" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">In talking over their route the evening before,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03077" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination</span>

            <span id="said_no_03079" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.</span>

            <span id="said_no_03081" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said her aunt; </span>

            <span id="said_no_03083" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was distressed.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03084" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She felt that</span>

            <span id="said_no_03095" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">It would be dreadful!</span>

            <span id="said_no_03098" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">it would be better to speak
