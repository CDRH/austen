            <span id="said_no_00259" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw
              superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such
              as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met,
              that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which
              she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but</span>
            <span id="said_no_00260" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she considered with pleasure that</span>
            <span id="said_no_00261" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top"> it was not likely to be
              discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner
              which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00262" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00263" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“It may perhaps be pleasant,”</span>

            <span id="said_no_00265" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a
              disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of
              fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost
              every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely — a slight preference is natural
              enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a woman had better
              show more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she
              does not help him on.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00266" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.”</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00267" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.”</span>

            <span id="said_no_00268" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must
              find it out.”</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00269" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet
              tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every
              moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention.
              When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.”</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00270" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Your plan is a good one,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00271" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied Elizabeth, </span>
            <span id="said_no_00272" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were
              determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As
              yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
              dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough
              to make her understand his character.”</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00273" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she
              might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together — and four
              evenings may do a great deal.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00274" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un
              better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00275" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“Well,”</span>

            <span id="said_no_00277" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Charlotte Lucas" data-placement="auto top">“I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I
              should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is
              entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not
              advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better
              to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00278" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and
              that you would never act in this way yourself.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00279" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting
              that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00280" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be</span>

            <span id="said_no_00283" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that</span>
            <span id="said_no_00284" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top"> she hardly had a good feature

              dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect

              really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00311" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, </span>

            <span id="said_no_00315" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she
              could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in
              consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.</span>

              likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and
              unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to
              purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three
              officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.</span>
