              When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her
              into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
              as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
              entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00799" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were
              instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself directly to Miss
              Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for
              Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the
              change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat down by
              her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight. </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00800" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table — but in vain.
              She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00801" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She assured him that</span>
            <span id="said_no_00802" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msb" data-placement="auto top">no one intended to
              play,</span>
            <span id="said_no_00803" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore
              nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,
              principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and
          she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
          question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second
          volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, <span id="said_no_00804" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“How pleasant it is to spend an evening
            in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my
            own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.” </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00805" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the
              room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00806" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I
              would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to
              whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00807" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“If you mean Darcy,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00808" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried her brother, </span>
            <span id="said_no_00809" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins — but as for the ball, it
              is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00810" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“I should like balls infinitely better,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00811" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she replied, </span>
            <span id="said_no_00812" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
              tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
              the day.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00813" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much
              like a ball.” </span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00814" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her
              figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings,
              she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00815" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about
              the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00816" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real
            object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and
            unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but </span>
          <span id="said_no_00817" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">he</span>
          <span id="said_no_00818" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">declined it,</span>
          <span id="said_no_00819" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">observing that</span>
          <span id="said_no_00820" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_dar" data-placement="auto top">he could imagine but two motives
            for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.</span>
          
            <span id="said_no_00821" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msb" data-placement="auto top">“What could he mean?</span>
            <span id="said_no_00822" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was dying to know</span>
            <span id="said_no_00823" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msb" data-placement="auto top">what could be his

          <span id="said_no_00824" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">— and</span>
          <span id="said_no_00825" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">asked Elizabeth whether</span>
          <span id="said_no_00826" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_msb" data-placement="auto top">she could at all understand him?

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00827" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Not at all,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00828" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> was her answer; </span>
            <span id="said_no_00829" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing
              him, will be to ask nothing about it.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00830" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered
              therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00831" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00832" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00833" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Darcy" data-placement="auto top">“You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's
              confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the
              first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00834" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! shocking!”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00835" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> cried Miss Bingley.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00840" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bingley" data-placement="auto top">“But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy

              as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.” </span>

              I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at

              world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about
