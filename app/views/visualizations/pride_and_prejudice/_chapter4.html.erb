              When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her
              sister just how very much she admired him.</span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_00159" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“He is just what a young man ought to be,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00160" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said she, </span>
            <span id="said_no_00161" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much
              ease, with such perfect good breeding !”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00162" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“He is also handsome,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_00163" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied Elizabeth, </span>
            <span id="said_no_00164" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby
              complete.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00165" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect
              such a compliment.”</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00166" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference
              between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his
              asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry
              for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00167" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Dear Lizzy!”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00168" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see
              a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00169" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I
              think.”</span>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00170" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough —
              one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design — to take the good of everybody's character and make it still
              better, and say nothing of the bad — belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to
              his.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00171" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Certainly not — at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse
              with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in
              her.”</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00172" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not
              been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too
              unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good
              humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather
              handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending
              more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly
              of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their
              brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00173" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his
              father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his
              county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of
              his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00174" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only
              established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table — nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more
              fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was
              tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour — was pleased with the
              situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00175" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of
              character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater
              contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance,
              and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He
              was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had
              greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00176" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.</span>

            <span id="said_no_00178" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_bing" data-placement="auto top"> had never met with more
              pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he
              had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00179" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Darcy, on the contrary,</span>

              people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention
              or pleasure.</span>
