            <span id="said_no_01582" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">congratulated both him and herself in warm terms</span>

              trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful
              modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01589" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally
              satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help
              saying so.</span>

              myself directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make her know it.”

              altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually
              persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could
              not contribute much to my felicity.” </span>

              You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not

            <span id="said_no_01613" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> Elizabeth replied that</span>

            <span id="said_no_01617" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is
              it not so, Mrs. Bennet?” </span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01618" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, or I will never see her again.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01619" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a
              stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see
              you again if you do.” </span>
          
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_01620" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had
              persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01621" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking in this way? You promised me

            <span id="said_no_01623" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied her husband, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01624" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of
              my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01625" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the
              point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with
              all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her
              attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01626" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of
              himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her
              was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret. </span>

          <span id="said_no_01627" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.</span>
          
            <span id="said_no_01628" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was </span>

              this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01631" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same
            news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where</span>

            <span id="said_no_01636" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_01637" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she added in a melancholy tone, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01638" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
              nobody feels for my poor nerves.” </span>

            <span id="said_no_01639" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.</span>

            <span id="said_no_01640" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Aye, there she comes,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_01641" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> continued Mrs. Bennet, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01642" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we
              were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy — if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of
              marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all — and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you — and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library,
              you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.
              Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for
              talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! — But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01643" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her
              or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.
              Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, </span>
          
          
            <span id="said_no_01644" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
              let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.” </span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01645" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground,

          <span id="said_no_01646" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose
            inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and
            pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation: </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_01647" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! Mr. Collins!”</span>

            <span id="said_no_01652" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01653" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Collins" data-placement="auto top"> “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the
              duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps
              not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that
              resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider
              me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid
              yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in
              having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through
              the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and
              if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.” </span>
