              Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by

            <span id="said_no_01948" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who
              came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by
              nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own
              warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an
              amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there
              subsisted a very particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01949" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and
              describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01950" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01951" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsb" data-placement="auto top">They had all been very
              ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01952" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I do not blame Jane,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_01953" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> she continued, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01954" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh,
              sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her
              an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that
              the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am
              sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think
              of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell
              us, of long sleeves.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01955" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and
              Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01956" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.</span>
          
            <span id="said_no_01957" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top"> “It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_01958" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said she.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01959" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you
              describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that
              these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01960" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“An excellent consolation in its way,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_01961" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Elizabeth, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01962" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a
              girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01963" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“But that expression of 'violently in in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so
              indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real,
              strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01964" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other
              people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young
              ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general
              incivility the very essence of love?” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01965" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“Oh, yes! — of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane!
              I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you,
              Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be
              of service — and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01966" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready
              acquiescence.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01967" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“I hope,”</span>
            <span id="said_no_01968" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top"> added Mrs. Gardiner, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01969" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">"that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in
              so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that
              they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01970" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of
              his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy
              may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse
              him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01971" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Gardiner" data-placement="auto top">“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond
              with his sister? She  will not be able to help calling.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01972" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Elizabeth Bennet" data-placement="auto top">“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.” </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01973" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the
              still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject</span>
            <span id="said_no_01974" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">which convinced her, on examination, that</span>
            <span id="said_no_01975" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">she did not consider it
              entirely hopeless. It was possible, and</span>
            <span id="said_no_01976" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">sometimes she thought it</span>
            <span id="said_no_01977" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_eliz" data-placement="auto top">probable, that his
              affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions. </span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01978" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in
              her thoughts at the same time, than as</span>
            <span id="said_no_01979" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she hoped that,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01980" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_jane" data-placement="auto top">by Caroline's not living in
              the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01981" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the
              officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that
              they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it — of which
              officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him,
              narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain
              enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the
              imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01982" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general
              powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he
              belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five
              years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01983" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here
              consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could
              give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made
              acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01984" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">she tried to</span>
            <span id="said_no_01985" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsg" data-placement="auto top">remember some of that
              gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it,</span>
            <span id="said_no_01986" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>
            <span id="said_no_01987" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.001.nar_mrsg" data-placement="auto top">was confident at last that
              she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.</span>
