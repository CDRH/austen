                <p><span id="said_no_02601" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine’s disposition was
                        not naturally sedentary, nor had her habits been ever very industrious; but
                        whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort, her mother could
                        not but perceive them now to be greatly increased. She could neither sit
                        still nor employ herself for ten minutes together, walking round the garden
                        and orchard again and again, as if nothing but motion was voluntary; and it
                        seemed as if she could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed
                        for any time in the parlour. Her loss of spirits was a yet greater
                        alteration. In her rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature
                        of herself; but in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all
                        that she had been before.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02602" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">For two days Mrs.
                            Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint; but when a third night’s
                            rest had neither restored her cheerfulness, improved her in useful
                            activity, nor given her a greater inclination for needlework, she could
                            no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_02603" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Morland" data-placement="auto top">“My dear Catherine, I am
                            afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do not know when poor
                            Richard’s cravats would be done, if he had no friend but you. Your head
                            runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for everything — a
                            time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You have had a long run
                            of amusement, and now you must try to be useful.”</span></p>

                <p>Catherine took up her work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that <span id="said_no_02604" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“her head did not run upon
                            Bath — much.”</span></p>

                            about General Tilney, and that is very simple of you; for ten to one
                            whether you ever see him again. You should never fret about
                            trifles.”</span><span id="said_no_02606" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">
                            After a short silence — </span><span id="said_no_02607" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Morland" data-placement="auto top">“I hope, my Catherine, you are not getting out of
                            humour with home because it is not so grand as Northanger. That would be
                            turning your visit into an evil indeed. Wherever you are you should
                            always be contented, but especially at home, because there you must
                            spend the most of your time. I did not quite like, at breakfast, to hear
                            you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02608" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“I am sure I do not care about
                        the bread. It is all the same to me what I eat.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02609" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Morland" data-placement="auto top">“There is a very clever essay
                        in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject, about young girls
                        that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance — The Mirror, I
                        think. I will look it out for you some day or other, because I am sure it
                        will do you good.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02610" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine said no more, and,
                        with an endeavour to do right, applied to her work; but, after a few
                        minutes, sunk again, without knowing it herself, into languor and
                        listlessness, moving herself in her chair, from the irritation of weariness,
                        much oftener than she moved her needle. Mrs. Morland watched the progress of
                        this relapse; and seeing, in her daughter’s absent and dissatisfied look,
                        the full proof of that repining spirit to which she had now begun to
                        attribute her want of cheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book
                        in question, anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady. It
                        was some time before she could find what she looked for; and other family
                        matters occurring to detain her, a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she
                        returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped. Her
                        avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself, she
                        knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes, till, on
                        entering the room, the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had
                        never seen before.</span>

                        disposed towards each, and instantly, pleased by his appearance, received

                        anything to the purpose. Returning in silence to his seat, therefore, he
                        remained for some minutes most civilly answering all Mrs. Morland’s common
                        remarks about the weather and roads. Catherine meanwhile — the

                        Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it. Some
                        explanation on his father’s account he had to give; but his first purpose
                        was to explain himself, and before they reached Mr. Allen’s grounds he had
                        done it so well that Catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too
                        often. She was assured of his affection; and that heart in return was
                        solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty equally knew was already entirely his
                        own; for, though Henry was now sincerely attached to her, though he felt and
                        delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her
                        society, I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than
                        gratitude, or, in other words, that a persuasion of her partiality for him
                        had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought. It is a new
                        circumstance in romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an
                        heroine’s dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a wild
                        imagination will at least be all my own.</span></p>

                        scarcely opened her lips, dismissed them to the ecstasies of another
                        tete-a-tete; and before it was suffered to close, she was enabled to judge

                        necessity of a conscientious rejection, by engaging her faith before he
                        mentioned the subject; and as he proceeded to give the particulars, and
                        explain the motives of his father’s conduct, her feelings soon hardened into

                        which a better pride would have been ashamed to own. She was guilty only of

                        discovering his error, to turn her from the house seemed the best, though to
                        his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself, and his

                        speaking terms with a man of General Tilney’s importance, had been joyfully
                        and proudly communicative; and being at that time not only in daily
                        expectation of Morland’s engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well
                        resolved upon marrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to
                        represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had
                        made him believe them. With whomsoever he was, or was likely to be
                        connected, his own consequence always required that theirs should be great,
                        and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their
                        fortune. The expectations of his friend Morland, therefore, from the first
                        overrated, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually
                        increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the
                        moment, by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland’s
                        preferment, trebling his private fortune, bestowing a rich aunt, and sinking
                        half the children, he was able to represent the whole family to the general
                        in a most respectable light. For Catherine, however, the peculiar object of
                        the general’s curiosity, and his own speculations, he had yet something more
                        in reserve, and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could
                        give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen’s estate. Her intimacy
                        there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied
                        hereafter; and</span>

                        acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02664" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">naturally followed. Upon
                        such intelligence the general had proceeded; for never had it occurred to
                        him to doubt its authority. Thorpe’s interest in the family, by his sister’s
                        approaching connection with one of its members, and his own views on another
                        (circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness), seemed
                        sufficient vouchers for his truth; and to these were added the absolute
                        facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless, of Miss Morland’s being
                        under their care, and — as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to
                        judge — of their treating her with parental kindness. His resolution
                        was soon formed. Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in
                        the countenance of his son; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe’s communication, he
                        almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted
                        interest and ruining his dearest hopes. Catherine herself could not be more
                        ignorant at the time of all this, than his own children. Henry and Eleanor,
                        perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father’s
                        particular respect, had seen with astonishment the suddenness, continuance,
                        and extent of his attention; and though latterly, from some hints which had
                        accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his
                        power to attach her, Henry was convinced of his father’s believing it to be
                        an advantageous connection, it was not till the late explanation at
                        Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which
                        had hurried him on. That they were false, the general had learnt from the
                        very person who had suggested them, from Thorpe himself, whom he had chanced
                        to meet again in town, and who, under the influence of exactly opposite
                        feelings, irritated by Catherine’s refusal, and yet more by the failure of a
                        very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and
                        Isabella, convinced that they were separated forever, and spurning a
                        friendship which could be no longer serviceable, hastened to contradict all
                        that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands —</span>

                        his opinion of their circumstances and character, misled by the rhodomontade

                        the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither;
                        for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between
                        the families, with the most liberal proposals, he had, on being brought to
                        the point by the shrewdness of the relator, been constrained to acknowledge
                        himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support. They
                        were, in fact, a necessitous family; numerous, too, almost beyond example;
                        by no means respected in their own neighbourhood, as he had lately had
                        particular opportunities of discovering; aiming at a style of life which
                        their fortune could not warrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthy
                        connections; a forward, bragging, scheming race.</span></p>

                        himself. He blushed for the narrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to
                        expose. The conversation between them at Northanger had been of the most
                        unfriendly kind. Henry’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been
                        treated, on comprehending his father’s views, and being ordered to acquiesce
                        in them, had been open and bold. The general, accustomed on every ordinary
                        occasion to give the law in his family, prepared for no reluctance but of
                        feeling, no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words,
                        could ill brook the opposition of his son, steady as the sanction of reason
                        and the dictate of conscience could make it. But, in such a cause, his
                        anger, though it must shock, could not intimidate Henry, who was sustained
                        in his purpose by a conviction of its justice. He felt himself bound as much
                        in honour as in affection to Miss Morland, and believing that heart to be
                        his own which he had been directed to gain, no unworthy retraction of a
                        tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger, could shake his
                        fidelity, or influence the resolutions it prompted.</span></p>

                        intention of offering her his hand. The general was furious in his anger,
                        and they parted in dreadful disagreement. Henry, in an agitation of mind
                        which many solitary hours were required to compose, had returned almost
                        instantly to Woodston, and, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun
