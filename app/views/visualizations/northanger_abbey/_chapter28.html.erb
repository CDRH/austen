                        the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object
                        in his absence. His departure gave Catherine the first experimental
                        conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain. The happiness with which
                        their time now passed, every employment voluntary, every laugh indulged,
                        every meal a scene of ease and good humour, walking where they liked and
                        when they liked, their hours, pleasures, and fatigues at their own command,
                        made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the general’s presence
                        had imposed, and most thankfully feel their present release from it. Such
                        ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more
                        every day; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to
                        leave the one, and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the
                        other, she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy; but
                        she was now in the fourth week of her visit; before the general came home,
                        the fourth week would be turned, and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if
                        she stayed much longer. This was a painful consideration whenever it
                        occurred; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02415" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">she very soon
                        resolved</span>

                <p><span id="said_no_02417" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Aware that if she gave
                        herself much time, she might feel it difficult to bring forward so
                        unpleasant a subject, she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone
                        with Eleanor, and of Eleanor’s being in the middle of a speech about
                        something very different, to start forth her obligation of going away very
                        soon. Eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned. She had</span>

                        company for a much longer time — had been misled (perhaps by her
                        wishes) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised — and
                        could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure
                        it was to her to have her there, they would be too generous to hasten her
                        return.”</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02419" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine explained:</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02420" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! As to that, Papa and Mamma
                        were in no hurry at all. As long as she was happy, they would always be
                        satisfied.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02421" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_ele" data-placement="auto top">“Then why, might she ask, in such a
                        hurry herself to leave them?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02422" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! Because she had been there so
                        long.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02423" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eleanor Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“Nay, if you can use such a
                        word, I can urge you no farther. If you think it long — ”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02424" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! No, I do not indeed. For
                        my own pleasure, I could stay with you as long again.”</span> And it was
                    directly settled that, till she had, her leaving them was not even to be thought
                    of. In having this cause of uneasiness so pleasantly removed, the force of the
                    other was likewise weakened. The kindness, the earnestness of Eleanor’s manner
                    in pressing her to stay, and Henry’s gratified look on being told that her stay
                    was determined, were such sweet proofs of her importance with them, as left her
                    only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without.
                    She did — almost always — believe that Henry loved her, and quite
                    always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them;
                    and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive
                    irritations.</p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02425" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Henry was not able to obey
                        his father’s injunction of remaining wholly at Northanger in attendance on
                        the ladies, during his absence in London, the engagements of his curate at
                        Woodston obliging him to leave them on Saturday for a couple of nights. His
                        loss was not now what it had been while the general was at home; it lessened
                        their gaiety, but did not ruin their comfort; and the two girls agreeing in
                        occupation, and improving in intimacy, found themselves so well sufficient
                        for the time to themselves, that it was eleven o’clock, rather a late hour
                        at the abbey, before they quitted the supper-room on the day of Henry’s
                        departure. They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed, as
                        far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge, that a carriage
                        was driving up to the door, and the next moment confirmed the idea by the
                        loud noise of the house-bell.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02426" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">After the first
                            perturbation of surprise had passed away, in a</span>

                            the matter?”</span>

                            by Eleanor to be her eldest brother, whose arrival was often as sudden,
                            if not quite so unseasonable, and accordingly she hurried down to
                            welcome him.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02429" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine walked on to her
                        chamber, making up her mind as well as she could, to a further acquaintance
                        with Captain Tilney, and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression
                        his conduct had given her, and</span>

                        under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially
                        painful.</span>

                        Thorpe; and indeed, as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had
                        acted, there could be no danger of it; and as long as all mention of Bath
                        scenes were avoided, she thought she could behave to him very
                        civilly.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02436" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">In such considerations time
                        passed away, and</span>

                        that Eleanor should be so glad to see him, and have so much to say,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02438" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">for half an hour was almost
                        gone since his arrival, and Eleanor did not come up.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02439" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">At that moment Catherine
                        thought she heard her step in the gallery, and listened for its continuance;
                        but all was silent. Scarcely, however, had she convicted her fancy of error,
                        when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start; it
                        seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway — and in another
                        moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it. She
                        trembled a little at the idea of anyone’s approaching so cautiously; but
                        resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm, or
                        misled by a raised imagination, she stepped quietly forward, and opened the
                        door. Eleanor, and only Eleanor, stood there. Catherine’s spirits, however,
                        were tranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor’s cheeks were pale, and
                        her manner greatly agitated. Though evidently intending to come in, it
                        seemed an effort to enter the room, and a still greater to speak when there.
                        Catherine, supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney’s account, could only
                        express her concern by silent attention, obliged her to be seated, rubbed
                        her temples with lavender-water, and hung over her with affectionate
                        solicitude.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02440" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eleanor Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“My dear Catherine, you
                            must not — you must not indeed — “</span>
                        <span id="said_no_02441" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">were Eleanor’s first
                            connected words.</span>

                            kindness distracts me — I cannot bear it — I come to you on
                            such an errand!”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02443" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Errand! To me!”</span></p>

                            into Catherine’s mind, and turning as pale as her friend, she
                            exclaimed,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_02446" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“’Tis a messenger from

                            looking at her most compassionately;</span>
                        <span id="said_no_02449" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eleanor Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“it is no one from

                            her eyes were turned to the ground as she mentioned his name. His
                            unlooked-for return was enough in itself to make Catherine’s heart sink,
                            and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to
                            be told. She said nothing; and Eleanor, endeavouring to collect herself
                            and speak with firmness, but with eyes still cast down, soon went
                            on.</span>
                        <span id="said_no_02451" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eleanor Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“You are too good, I am

                            am indeed a most unwilling messenger. After what has so lately passed,
                            so lately been settled between us — how joyfully, how thankfully
                            on my side! — as to your continuing here as I hoped for many, many
                            weeks longer, how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be
                            accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given
                            us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words. My
                            dear Catherine, we are to part. My father has recollected an engagement
                            that takes our whole family away on Monday. We are going to Lord
                            Longtown’s, near Hereford, for a fortnight. Explanation and apology are
                            equally impossible. I cannot attempt either.”</span></p>

                            indeed I am not. I can finish my visit here, you know, at any time; or I

                        could say when they might meet again? And all this by such a man as General
                        Tilney, so polite, so well bred, and heretofore so particularly fond of her!

                        must have had the misfortune to offend him. Eleanor had wished to spare her
                        from so painful a notion, but Catherine could not believe it possible that
                        any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person

                        Sleep, or repose that deserved the name of sleep, was out of the question.
                        That room, in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first
                        arrival, was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers. Yet
                        how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then
                        — how mournfully superior in reality and substance! Her anxiety had
                        foundation in fact, her fears in probability; and with a mind so occupied in
                        the contemplation of actual and natural evil, the solitude of her situation,
                        the darkness of her chamber, the antiquity of the building, were felt and
                        considered without the smallest emotion; and though the wind was high, and
                        often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house, she heard it
                        all as she lay awake, hour after hour, without curiosity or

                        she was almost dressed, and her packing almost finished. The possibility of
                        some conciliatory message from the general occurred to her as his daughter

                        been useless here; it was not called for; neither clemency nor dignity was
                        put to the trial — Eleanor brought no message. Very little passed
                        between them on meeting; each found her greatest safety in silence, and few
                        and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs,
                        Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress, and Eleanor with more
                        goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk. When everything was
                        done they left the room, Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her
                        friend to throw a parting glance on every well-known, cherished object, and
                        went down to the breakfast-parlour, where breakfast was prepared. She tried
                        to eat, as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her
                        friend comfortable; but she had no appetite, and could not swallow many
                        mouthfuls. The contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room
                        gave her fresh misery, and strengthened her distaste for everything before
                        her.</span>

                        ago since they had met there to the same repast, but in circumstances how
                        different! With what cheerful ease, what happy, though false, security, had
                        she then looked around her, enjoying everything present, and fearing little
                        in future, beyond Henry’s going to Woodston for a day! Happy, happy
                        breakfast! For Henry had been there; Henry had sat by her and helped
                        her.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02485" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">These reflections were long
                        indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion, who sat as deep in

                        to startle and recall them to the present moment. Catherine’s colour rose at
                        the sight of it; and the indignity with which she was treated, striking at
                        that instant on her mind with peculiar force, made her for a short time
                        sensible only of resentment. Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and

                            moment, and she instantly said,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_02493" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eleanor Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“Oh, Eleanor, I will

                <p><span id="said_no_02494" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was yet another point

                        settle,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02496" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">though somewhat embarrassed
                        in speaking of.</span>

                        so long an absence from home, Catherine might not be provided with money
                        enough for the expenses of her journey,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02498" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">and, upon suggesting it to
                        her with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to be exactly
                        the case. Catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment, but,
                        upon examining her purse,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02499" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">was convinced that</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02500" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">but for this kindness of her
                        friend, she might have been turned from the house without even the means of
                        getting home;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02501" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">and the distress in which
                        she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both, scarcely
                        another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together.
                        Short, however, was that time.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02502" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The carriage was soon
                            announced to be ready; and Catherine, instantly rising, a long and
                            affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each
                            other adieu; and, as they entered the hall, unable to leave the house
                            without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by
                            either, she paused a moment, and with quivering lips just</span>

                            that she left</span>

                            remembrance for her absent friend.”</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02505" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">But with this approach to
                        his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings; and, hiding her
                        face as well as she could with her handkerchief, she darted across the hall,
                        jumped into the chaise, and in a moment was driven from the door.</span></p>
