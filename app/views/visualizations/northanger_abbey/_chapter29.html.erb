                <p><span id="said_no_02506" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine was too wretched to
                        be fearful. The journey in itself had no terrors for her; and she began it
                        without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness. Leaning back
                        in one corner of the carriage, in a violent burst of tears, she was conveyed
                        some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head; and the
                        highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view
                        before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it. Unfortunately, the
                        road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so
                        happily passed along in going to and from Woodston; and, for fourteen miles,
                        every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on
                        which she had first looked under impressions so different. Every mile, as it
                        brought her nearer Woodston, added to her sufferings, and when within the
                        distance of five, she passed the turning which led to it, and thought of
                        Henry,</span>

                        unconscious,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02508" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">her grief and agitation were
                        excessive.</span></p>

                        place had been one of the happiest of her life. It was there, it was on that
                        day, that the general had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry
                        and herself, had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive
                        conviction of his actually wishing their marriage. Yes, only ten days ago
                        had he elated her by his pointed regard — had he even confused her by
                        his too significant reference! And now — what had she done, or what
                        had she omitted to do, to merit such a change?</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02510" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">The only offence against him of
                        which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to
                        reach his knowledge. Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking
                        suspicions which she had so idly entertained; and equally safe</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02511" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">did she believe</span>

                        at least, Henry could not have betrayed her. If, indeed, by any strange
                        mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared
                        to think and look for, of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations,
                        she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation. If aware of her
                        having viewed him as a murderer, she could not wonder at his even turning
                        her from his house. But a justification so full of torture to herself, she
                        trusted, would not be in his power.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02513" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Anxious as were all her
                        conjectures on this point, it was not, however, the one on which she dwelt
                        most. There was a thought yet nearer, a more prevailing, more impetuous
                        concern.</span>

                        and look, when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her
                        being gone,</span>

                        interest to rise over every other,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02516" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">to be never ceasing,
                        alternately irritating and soothing; it sometimes suggested the dread of his
                        calm acquiescence, and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in
                        his regret and resentment.</span>

                        not dare to speak; but to Eleanor — what might he not say to Eleanor
                        about her?</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02518" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">In this unceasing recurrence
                        of doubts and inquiries, on any one article of which her mind was incapable
                        of more than momentary repose, the hours passed away, and her journey
                        advanced much faster than she looked for. The pressing anxieties of thought,
                        which prevented her from noticing anything before her, when once beyond the
                        neighbourhood of Woodston, saved her at the same time from watching her
                        progress; and though no object on the road could engage a moment’s
                        attention, she found no stage of it tedious. From this, she was preserved
                        too by another cause, by feeling no eagerness for her journey’s conclusion;
                        for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the
                        pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best, even after an absence such
                        as hers — an eleven weeks’ absence.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02519" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">What had she to say that would not
                        humble herself and pain her family, that would not increase her own grief by
                        the confession of it, extend an useless resentment, and perhaps involve the
                        innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will? She could never do
                        justice to Henry and Eleanor’s merit; she felt it too strongly for
                        expression; and should a dislike be taken against them, should they be
                        thought of unfavourably, on their father’s account, it would cut her to the
                        heart.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02520" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">With these feelings, she
                        rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well-known spire which
                        would announce her within twenty miles of home. Salisbury she had known to
                        be her point on leaving Northanger; but after the first stage she had been
                        indebted to the post-masters for the names of the places which were then to
                        conduct her to it; so great had been her ignorance of her route. She met
                        with nothing, however, to distress or frighten her. Her youth, civil
                        manners, and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller
                        like herself could require; and stopping only to change horses, she
                        travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm, and between
                        six and seven o’clock in the evening found herself entering
                        Fullerton.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02521" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">A heroine returning, at the
                        close of her career, to her native village, in all the triumph of recovered
                        reputation, and all the dignity of a countess, with a long train of noble
                        relations in their several phaetons, and three waiting-maids in a travelling
                        chaise and four, behind her, is an event on which the pen of the contriver
                        may well delight to dwell; it gives credit to every conclusion, and the
                        author must share in the glory she so liberally bestows. But my affair is
                        widely different; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and
                        disgrace; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness. A
                        heroine in a hack post-chaise is such a blow upon sentiment, as no attempt
                        at grandeur or pathos can withstand. Swiftly therefore shall her post-boy
                        drive through the village, amid the gaze of Sunday groups, and speedy shall
                        be her descent from it.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02522" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">But, whatever might be the
                        distress of Catherine’s mind, as she thus advanced towards the parsonage,
                        and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it, she was
                        preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went; first,
                        in the appearance of her carriage — and secondly, in herself. The
                        chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in Fullerton, the whole family were
                        immediately at the window; and to have it stop at the sweep-gate was a
                        pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy — a pleasure
                        quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children, a boy and girl of
                        six and four years old, who expected a brother or sister in every carriage.
                        Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine! Happy the voice that
                        proclaimed the discovery! But whether such happiness were the lawful
                        property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02523" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her father, mother, Sarah,
                        George, and Harriet, all assembled at the door to welcome her with
                        affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awaken the best feelings of
                        Catherine’s heart; and in the embrace of each, as she stepped from the
                        carriage, she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed
                        possible. So surrounded, so caressed, she was even happy! In the joyfulness
                        of family love everything for a short time was subdued, and the pleasure of
                        seeing her, leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity, they
                        were all seated round the tea-table, which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the
                        comfort of the poor traveller, whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her
                        notice, before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was
                        addressed to her.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02524" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Reluctantly, and with much
                        hesitation, did she then begin what might perhaps, at the end of half an
                        hour, be termed, by the courtesy of her hearers, an explanation; but
                        scarcely, within that time, could they at all discover the cause, or collect
                        the particulars, of her sudden return. They were far from being an irritable
                        race; far from any quickness in catching, or bitterness in resenting,
                        affronts: but here, when the whole was unfolded, was an insult not to be
                        overlooked, nor, for the first half hour, to be easily pardoned. Without
                        suffering any romantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter’s long
                        and lonely journey,</span>

                        been productive of much unpleasantness to her; that it was what they could

                        General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly — neither as
                        a gentleman nor as a parent. Why he had done it, what could have provoked
                        him to such a breach of hospitality, and so suddenly turned all his partial
                        regard for their daughter into actual ill will,</span>
