                <p><span id="said_no_01582" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">With a mind thus full of
                        happiness, Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed
                        away, without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together. She
                        began first to be sensible of this, and to sigh for her conversation, as she
                        walked along the pump-room one morning, by Mrs. Allen’s side, without
                        anything to say or to hear; and scarcely had she felt a five minutes’
                        longing of friendship, before the object of it appeared, and inviting her to
                        a secret conference, led the way to a seat.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01583" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“This is my favourite

                            down on a bench between the doors, which commanded a tolerable view of
                            everybody entering at either;</span>
                        <span id="said_no_01585" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“it is so out of the
                            way.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01586" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine, observing
                            that Isabella’s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the
                            other, as in eager expectation, and remembering how often she had been
                            falsely accused of being arch, thought the present a fine opportunity
                            for being really so; and therefore gaily said,</span>

                        <span id="said_no_01590" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“do not think me such a
                            simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow. It would
                            be hideous to be always together; we should be the jest of the place.
                            And so you are going to Northanger! I am amazingly glad of it. It is one
                            of the finest old places in England, I understand. I shall depend upon a
                            most particular description of it.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01592" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“I am not looking for anybody.
                        One’s eyes must be somewhere, and you know what a foolish trick I have of
                        fixing mine, when my thoughts are an hundred miles off. I am amazingly
                        absent; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world.</span>

                        had something in particular to tell me?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01596" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! Yes, and so I have. But
                        here is a proof of what I was saying. My poor head, I had quite forgot it.
                        Well, the thing is this: I have just had a letter from John; you can guess
                        the contents.”</span></p>

                        this is being quite absurd! Modesty, and all that, is very well in its way,
                        but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming. I have no
                        idea of being so overstrained! It is fishing for compliments. His attentions
                        were such as a child must have noticed. And</span>

                        moment — except just his asking me to dance the first day of his
                        coming. And as to making me an offer, or anything like it, there must be
                        some unaccountable mistake. I could not have misunderstood a thing of that
                        kind, you know! And, as I ever wish to be believed, I solemnly protest that
                        no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us. The last half hour
                        before he went away! It must be all and completely a mistake — for I
                        did not see him once that whole morning.”</span></p>

                        your father’s consent came — and I am pretty sure that you and John
                        were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01618" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Are you? Well, if you
                            say it, it was so, I dare say — but for the life of me, I cannot
                            recollect it. I do remember now being with you, and seeing him as well
                            as the rest — but that we were ever alone for five minutes —
                            However, it is not worth arguing about, for whatever might pass on his
                            side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection of it, that I
                            never thought, nor expected, nor wished for anything of the kind from
                            him. I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me
                            — but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side; I never
                            had the smallest idea of it. Pray undeceive him as soon as you can, and
                            tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I
                            ought to say — but make him understand what I mean, in the
                            properest way. I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours,
                            Isabella, I am sure; but you know very well that if I could think of one
                            man more than another — he is not the person.”</span>

                            John — is not it so?”</span></p>

                        sure I shall not tease you any further. John desired me to speak to you on
                        the subject, and therefore I have. But I confess, as soon as I read his
                        letter, I thought it a very foolish, imprudent business, and not likely to
                        promote the good of either; for what were you to live upon, supposing you
                        came together? You have both of you something, to be sure, but it is not a
                        trifle that will support a family nowadays; and after all that romancers may
                        say, there is no doing without money. I only wonder John could think of it;
                        he could not have received my last.”</span></p>

                            occur, and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one
                            wishes to stand by. But you may be assured that I am the last person in
                            the world to judge you severely. All those things should be allowed for

                            he is my brother, and who perhaps after all, you know, might be just as
                            happy without you, for people seldom know what they would be at, young
                            men especially, they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant. What I

                        she should miss her sisters; she was expecting her sisters every moment; so
                        that her dearest Catherine must excuse her, and must sit quietly down

                        acknowledged as her engagement. To doubt her truth or good intentions was
                        impossible; and yet, during the whole of their conversation her manner had

                        of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could
