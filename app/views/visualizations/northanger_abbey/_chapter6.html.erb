                <p><span id="said_no_00219" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The following conversation,
                        which took place between the two friends in the pump-room one morning, after
                        an acquaintance of eight or nine days, is given as a specimen of their very
                        warm attachment, and of the delicacy, discretion, originality of thought,
                        and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that
                        attachment.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00220" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">They met by appointment;
                            and as Isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend, her
                            first address naturally was,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00221" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“My dearest creature,
                            what can have made you so late? I have been waiting for you at least
                            this age!”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00222" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Have you, indeed! I am very
                        sorry for it; but really I thought I was in very good time. It is but just
                        one. I hope you have not been here long?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00223" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! These ten ages at least.
                        I am sure I have been here this half hour. But now, let us go and sit down
                        at the other end of the room, and enjoy ourselves. I have an hundred things
                        to say to you. In the first place, I was so afraid it would rain this
                        morning, just as I wanted to set off; it looked very showery, and that would
                        have thrown me into agonies! Do you know, I saw the prettiest hat you can
                        imagine, in a shop window in Milsom Street just now — very like yours,
                        only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green; I quite longed for it. But,
                        my dearest Catherine, what have you been doing with yourself all this
                        morning? Have you gone on with Udolpho?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00224" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, I have been reading it
                        ever since I woke; and I am got to the black veil.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00225" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Are you, indeed? How
                        delightful! Oh! I would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the
                        world! Are not you wild to know?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00226" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! Yes, quite; what can it
                        be? But do not tell me — I would not be told upon any account. I know
                        it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is Laurentina’s skeleton. Oh! I am
                        delighted with the book! I should like to spend my whole life in reading it.
                        I assure you, if it had not been to meet you, I would not have come away
                        from it for all the world.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00227" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Dear creature! How much I am
                        obliged to you; and when you have finished Udolpho, we will read the Italian
                        together; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind
                        for you.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00228" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Have you, indeed! How glad I
                        am! What are they all?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00229" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“I will read you their names
                        directly; here they are, in my pocketbook. Castle of Wolfenbach, Clermont,
                        Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of the Black Forest, Midnight Bell, Orphan
                        of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries. Those will last us some
                    time.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00230" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, pretty well; but are
                        they all horrid, are you sure they are all horrid?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00231" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, quite sure; for a
                        particular friend of mine, a Miss Andrews, a sweet girl, one of the sweetest
                        creatures in the world, has read every one of them. I wish you knew Miss
                        Andrews, you would be delighted with her. She is netting herself the
                        sweetest cloak you can conceive. I think her as beautiful as an angel, and I
                        am so vexed with the men for not admiring her! I scold them all amazingly
                        about it.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00232" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Scold them! Do you scold them
                        for not admiring her?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00233" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, that I do. There is
                        nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion
                        of loving people by halves; it is not my nature. My attachments are always
                        excessively strong. I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter
                        that if he was to tease me all night, I would not dance with him, unless he
                        would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel. The men think us
                        incapable of real friendship, you know, and I am determined to show them the
                        difference. Now, if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you, I
                        should fire up in a moment: but that is not at all likely, for you are just
                        the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00234" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Oh, dear!”</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00235" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">cried Catherine,
                            colouring.</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00236" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“How can you say
                            so?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00237" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“I know you very well;
                            you have so much animation, which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants,
                            for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her. Oh! I
                            must tell you, that just after we parted yesterday, I saw a young man
                            looking at you so earnestly — I am sure he is in love with
                            you.”</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00238" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine coloured, and
                            disclaimed again. Isabella laughed.</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00239" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“It is very true, upon my
                            honour, but I see how it is; you are indifferent to everybody’s
                            admiration, except that of one gentleman, who shall be nameless. Nay, I
                            cannot blame you” —</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00240" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">speaking more seriously
                            —</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00241" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“your feelings are easily
                            understood. Where the heart is really attached, I know very well how
                            little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else. Everything
                            is so insipid, so uninteresting, that does not relate to the beloved
                            object! I can perfectly comprehend your feelings.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00242" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“But you should not persuade
                        me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney, for perhaps I may never see
                        him again.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00243" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Not see him again! My dearest
                        creature, do not talk of it. I am sure you would be miserable if you thought
                        so!”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00244" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“No, indeed, I should not. I
                        do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him; but while I
                        have Udolpho to read, I feel as if nobody could make me miserable. Oh! The
                        dreadful black veil! My dear Isabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina’s
                        skeleton behind it.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00245" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“It is so odd to me, that you
                        should never have read Udolpho before; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to
                        novels.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00246" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“No, she does not. She very
                        often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself; but new books do not fall in our
                        way.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00247" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Sir Charles Grandison! That
                        is an amazing horrid book, is it not? I remember Miss Andrews could not get
                        through the first volume.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00248" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“It is not like Udolpho at
                        all; but yet I think it is very entertaining.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00249" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Do you indeed! You surprise
                        me; I thought it had not been readable. But, my dearest Catherine, have you
                        settled what to wear on your head tonight? I am determined at all events to
                        be dressed exactly like you. The men take notice of that sometimes, you
                        know.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00250" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“But it does not signify
                            if they do,”</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00251" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">said Catherine, very
                            innocently.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00252" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Signify! Oh, heavens! I make
                        it a rule never to mind what they say. They are very often amazingly
                        impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit, and make them keep their
                        distance.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00253" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Are they? Well, I never
                        observed that. They always behave very well to me.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00254" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! They give themselves such
                        airs. They are the most conceited creatures in the world, and think
                        themselves of so much importance! By the by, though I have thought of it a
                        hundred times, I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite
                        complexion in a man. Do you like them best dark or fair?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00255" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“I hardly know. I never much
                        thought about it. Something between both, I think. Brown — not fair,
                        and — and not very dark.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00256" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Very well, Catherine. That is
                        exactly he. I have not forgot</span>

                        I prefer light eyes, and as to complexion — do you know — I like
                        a sallow better than any other. You must not betray me, if you should ever
                        meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00260" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Betray you! What do you

                        believe I have said too much. Let us drop the subject.”</span></p>

                            amazement, complied, and after remaining a few moments silent, was on
                            the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more
                            than anything else in the world, Laurentina’s skeleton, when her friend
                            prevented her, by saying,</span>

                            us move away from this end of the room. Do you know, there are two
                            odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour. They really
                            put me quite out of countenance. Let us go and look at the arrivals.
                            They will hardly follow us there.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00264" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Away they walked to the book;
                        and while Isabella examined the names, it was Catherine’s employment to
                        watch the proceedings of these alarming young men.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00265" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“They are not coming this way,
