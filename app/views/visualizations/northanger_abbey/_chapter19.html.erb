                <p><span id="said_no_01671" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">A few days passed away, and
                        Catherine, though not allowing herself to suspect her friend, could not help
                        watching her closely. The result of her observations was not agreeable.
                        Isabella seemed an altered creature. When she saw her, indeed, surrounded
                        only by their immediate friends in Edgar’s Buildings or Pulteney Street, her
                        change of manners was so trifling that, had it gone no farther, it might
                        have passed unnoticed. A something of languid indifference, or of that
                        boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would
                        occasionally come across her; but had nothing worse appeared, that might
                        only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But when
                        Catherine saw her in public, admitting Captain Tilney’s attentions as
                        readily as they were offered, and allowing him almost an equal share with
                        James in her notice and smiles, the alteration became too positive to be
                        passed over. What could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her friend
                        could be at, was beyond her comprehension.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01672" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_9" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">Isabella could not be aware of the
                        pain she was inflicting;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01673" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">but it was a degree of
                        wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent. James was the
                        sufferer. She saw him grave and uneasy; and however careless of his present
                        comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart, to her it was always
                        an object. For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned. Though his
                        looks did not please her, his name was a passport to her goodwill, and she
                        thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment; for, in
                        spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump-room, his
                        behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella’s engagement that
                        she could not, upon reflection, imagine him aware of it.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01674" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">He might be jealous of her brother
                        as a rival, but if more had seemed implied, the fault must have been in her
                        misapprehension.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01675" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">She wished, by a gentle
                        remonstrance, to remind Isabella of her situation, and make her aware of
                        this double unkindness; but for remonstrance, either opportunity or
                        comprehension was always against her. If able to suggest a hint, Isabella
                        could never understand it. In this distress, the intended departure of the
                        Tilney family became her chief consolation; their journey into
                        Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days, and Captain Tilney’s
                        removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own. But Captain
                        Tilney had at present no intention of removing; he was not to be of the
                        party to Northanger; he was to continue at Bath. When Catherine knew this,
                        her resolution was directly made.</span>

                            while my father’s consent was uncertain, she fretted herself almost into

                        and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man; he has had about a week’s
                        acquaintance with your friend, and he has known her engagement almost as

                            Are you not carried a little too far? Would he thank you, either on his
                            own account or Miss Thorpe’s, for supposing that her affection, or at
                            least her good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of
                            Captain Tilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to
                            him only when unsolicited by anyone else? He cannot think this —
                            and you may be sure that he would not have you think it. I will not say,
                            ‘Do not be uneasy,’ because I know that you are so, at this moment; but
                            be as little uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual

                            that real jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no
                            disagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are open
                            to each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what is
                            required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will
                            never tease the other beyond what is known to be

                        by Isabella’s behaviour in their parting interview. The Thorpes spent the
                        last evening of Catherine’s stay in Pulteney Street, and nothing passed
                        between the lovers to excite her uneasiness, or make her quit them in
                        apprehension. James was in excellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly
                        placid. Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her
                        heart; but that at such a moment was allowable; and once she gave her lover
                        a flat contradiction, and once she drew back her hand; but Catherine
                        remembered Henry’s instructions, and placed it all to judicious affection.
                        The embraces, tears, and promises of the parting fair ones may be
                        fancied.</span></p>
