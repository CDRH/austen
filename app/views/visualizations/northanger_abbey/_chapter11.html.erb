                        sober-looking morning, the sun making only a few efforts to appear, and
                        Catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes.</span>

                        a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced.</span>

                        confirmation of her hopes, but Mr. Allen, not having his own skies and
                        barometer about him, declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine. She
                        applied to Mrs. Allen, and Mrs. Allen’s opinion was more positive.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00764" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“She had no doubt in the

                <p><span id="said_no_00784" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“Anybody would have thought
                        so indeed. There will be very few people in the pump-room, if it rains all
                        the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes, but I
                        dare say he will not, for he had rather do anything in the world than walk
                        out in a greatcoat; I wonder he should dislike it, it must be so
                        comfortable.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00792" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“I do not quite despair yet. I
                        shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve. This is just the time of
                        day for it to clear up, and I do think it looks a little lighter. There, it
                        is twenty minutes after twelve, and now I shall give it up entirely. Oh!
                        That we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany
                        and the south of France! — the night that poor St. Aubin died! —
                        such beautiful weather!”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00793" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">At half past twelve, when
                        Catherine’s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no
                        longer claim any merit from its amendment, the sky began voluntarily to
                        clear. A gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise; she looked round; the
                        clouds were parting, and she instantly returned to the window to watch over
                        and encourage the happy appearance. Ten minutes more made it certain that a
                        bright afternoon would succeed, and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen, who
                        had</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00794" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“always thought it would
                        clear up.”</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00795" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">But whether Catherine might
                        still expect her friends, whether there had not been too much rain for Miss
                        Tilney to venture, must yet be a question.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00796" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was too dirty for Mrs.
                        Allen to accompany her husband to the pump-room; he accordingly set off by
                        himself, and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her
                        notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages,
                        containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few
                        mornings back.</span></p>

                        John Thorpe was soon with them, and his voice was with them yet sooner, for
                        on the stairs he was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick.</span>

                        vehemently talked down as no reason at all; Mrs. Allen was called on to

                        breakfast-time, I verily believe at the same instant; and we should have
                        been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain. But it
                        does not signify, the nights are moonlight, and we shall do delightfully.
                        Oh! I am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and
                        quiet! So much better than going to the Lower Rooms. We shall drive directly

                            herself whisked into the marketplace. Still, however, and during the
                            length of another street, she entreated him to stop.</span>

                        complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing. She
                        listened reluctantly, and her replies were short. Blaize Castle remained her
                        only comfort; towards that, she still looked at intervals with pleasure;
                        though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk, and especially
                        rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys, she would willingly have given
                        up all the happiness which its walls could supply — the happiness of a
                        progress through a long suite of lofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of
                        magnificent furniture, though now for many years deserted — the
                        happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow, winding vaults, by a
                        low, grated door; or even of having their lamp, their only lamp,
                        extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and of being left in total darkness.
                        In the meanwhile, they proceeded on their journey without any mischance, and
                        were within view of the town of Keynsham, when a halloo from Morland, who

                        <span id="said_no_00887" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="John Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“we might have done it
                            very well. My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour, if
                            left to himself, and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to
                            that cursed broken-winded jade’s pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping
                            a horse and gig of his own.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00888" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“No, he is not,”</span>

                            warmly,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00890" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“for I am sure he could
                            not afford it.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00891" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="John Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“And why cannot he afford
                        it?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00892" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Because he has not money
                        enough.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00893" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="John Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“And whose fault is
                        that?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00894" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Nobody’s, that I know
                        of.”</span> Thorpe then said something in the loud, incoherent way to which
                    he had often recourse, about its being a d — thing to be miserly; and that
                    if people who rolled in money could not afford things, he did not know who
                    could, which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand. Disappointed of
                    what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment, she was less
                    and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so;
                    and they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words.</p>

                        out with Mr. Thorpe, the lady had asked whether any message had been left
                        for her; and on his saying no, had felt for a card, but said she had none
                        about her, and went away.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00900" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Pondering over these
                        heart-rending tidings, Catherine walked slowly upstairs.</span>

                            was met by Mr. Allen, who, on hearing the reason of their speedy return,
                            said,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00902" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“I am glad your brother
                            had so much sense; I am glad you are come back. It was a strange, wild
                            scheme.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00903" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">They all spent the evening
                        together at Thorpe’s. Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits; but
                        Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce, in the fate of which she shared,
                        by private partnership with Morland, a very good equivalent for the quiet
                        and country air of an inn at Clifton. Her satisfaction, too, in not being at
                        the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00904" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“How I pity the poor
                        creatures that are going there! How glad I am that I am not amongst them! I
                        wonder whether it will be a full ball or not! They have not begun dancing
                        yet. I would not be there for all the world. It is so delightful to have an
                        evening now and then to oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball.
                        I know the Mitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that is.
                        But I dare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you? I am sure you
                        do. Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you. I dare say we
                        could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of such
                        consequence.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00905" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine could almost have
                        accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her
                        sorrows, so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind, and so very
                        inadequate was the comfort she offered.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00906" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Do not be so dull, my
                            dearest creature,”</span> she whispered. <span id="said_no_00907" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“You will quite break my heart. It was
                            amazingly shocking, to be sure; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame.
                            Why were not they more punctual? It was dirty, indeed, but what did that
                            signify? I am sure John and I should not have minded it. I never mind
                            going through anything, where a friend is concerned; that is my
                            disposition, and John is just the same; he has amazing strong feelings.
                            Good heavens! What a delightful hand you have got! Kings, I vow! I never
                            was so happy in my life! I would fifty times rather you should have them
                            than myself.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00908" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">And now I may dismiss my
                        heroine to the sleepless couch, which is the true heroine’s portion; to a
                        pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears. And lucky may she think
                        herself, if she get another good night’s rest in the course of the next
