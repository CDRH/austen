                <p><span id="said_no_01534" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Allens had now entered on
                        the sixth week of their stay in Bath; and whether it should be the last was
                        for some time a question, to which Catherine listened with a beating
                        heart.</span>

                        could counterbalance. Her whole happiness seemed at stake, while the affair
                        was in suspense, and everything secured when it was determined that the
                        lodgings should be taken for another fortnight. What this additional
                        fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing
                        Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine’s speculation. Once or twice
                        indeed, since James’s engagement had taught her what could be done, she had
                        got so far as to indulge in a secret “perhaps,” but in general the felicity
                        of being with him for the present bounded her views: the present was now
                        comprised in another three weeks, and her happiness being certain for that
                        period, the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little
                        interest. In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged, she
                        visited Miss Tilney, and poured forth her joyful feelings. It was doomed to
                        be a day of trial. No sooner had</span>

                            se’nnight. A letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted
                            at home; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of
                            Longtown and General Courteney here, some of my very old friends, there
                            is nothing to detain me longer in Bath. And could we carry our selfish
                            point with you, we should leave it without a single regret. Can you, in
                            short, be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige
                            your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire? I am almost
                            ashamed to make the request, though its presumption would certainly
                            appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself. Modesty such as
                            yours — but not for the world would I pain it by open praise. If
                            you can be induced to honour us with a visit, you will make us happy
                            beyond expression. ‘Tis true, we can offer you nothing like the gaieties
                            of this lively place; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor
                            splendour, for our mode of living, as you see, is plain and
                            unpretending; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make
                            Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable.”</span></p>

                        ecstasy. Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its
                        expressions within the language of tolerable calmness.</span>

                        though gentle, in her secondary civilities, and the affair became in a few
                        minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to Fullerton would
                        allow.</span></p>

                        security, and disappointment; but they were now safely lodged in perfect
                        bliss; and with spirits elated to rapture, with Henry at her heart, and
                        Northanger Abbey on her lips, she hurried home to write her letter. Mr. and
                        Mrs. Morland, relying on the discretion of the friends to whom they had
                        already entrusted their daughter, felt no doubt of the propriety of an
                        acquaintance which had been formed under their eye, and sent therefore by
                        return of post their ready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire.</span>

                        seemed to cooperate for her advantage. By the kindness of her first friends,
                        the Allens, she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every
                        kind had met her. Her feelings, her preferences, had each known the
                        happiness of a return. Wherever she felt attachment, she had been able to
                        create it. The affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister.
                        The Tilneys, they, by whom, above all, she desired to be favourably thought
                        of, outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their
                        intimacy was to be continued.</span>

                        be the roof of an abbey!</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01577" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her passion for ancient
                        edifices was next in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney — and
                        castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image
                        did not fill. To see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or
                        the cloisters of the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though
                        to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for
                        desire. And yet, this was to happen. With all the chances against her of
                        house, hall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned up an abbey,
                        and she was to be its inhabitant. Its long, damp passages, its narrow cells
                        and ruined chapel, were to be within her daily reach, and she could not
                        entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends, some awful memorials
                        of an injured and ill-fated nun.</span></p>

                        should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home, that the
                        consciousness of it should be so meekly borne. The power of early habit only
                        could account for it. A distinction to which they had been born gave no
                        pride. Their superiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority
                        of person.</span></p>
