                <p><span id="said_no_01729" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry
                        to lose their young friend, whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her
                        a valuable companion, and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had
                        been gently increased. Her happiness in going with Miss Tilney, however,
                        prevented their wishing it otherwise; and, as they were to remain only one
                        more week in Bath themselves, her quitting them now would not long be felt.
                        Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street, where she was to breakfast, and saw
                        her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends; but so great was
                        her agitation in finding herself as one of the family, and so fearful was
                        she of not doing exactly what was right, and of not being able to preserve
                        their good opinion, that, in the embarrassment of the first five minutes,
                        she could almost have wished to return with him to Pulteney
                    Street.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01730" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Tilney’s manners and
                        Henry’s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings; but still she
                        was far from being at ease; nor could the incessant attentions of the
                        general himself entirely reassure her. Nay, perverse as it seemed, she
                        doubted whether she might not have felt less, had she been less attended to.
                        His anxiety for her comfort — his continual solicitations that she
                        would eat, and his often-expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste
                        — though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on
                        a breakfast-table — made it impossible for her to forget for a moment
                        that she was a visitor. She felt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew
                        not how to reply to it. Her tranquillity was not improved by the general’s
                        impatience for the appearance of his eldest son, nor by the displeasure he
                        expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down. She was
                        quite pained by the severity of his father’s reproof, which seemed
                        disproportionate to the offence; and much was her concern increased when she
                        found herself the principal cause of the lecture, and that his tardiness was
                        chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her. This was placing her in a
                        very uncomfortable situation, and she felt great compassion for Captain
                        Tilney, without being able to hope for his goodwill.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01731" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">He listened to his father in
                        silence, and attempted not any defence,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01732" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">which confirmed her in
                        fearing that</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01733" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top"> the inquietude of his mind, on
                        Isabella’s account, might, by keeping him long sleepless, have been the real
                        cause of his rising late.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01734" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was the first time of her
                        being decidedly in his company, and she had hoped to be now able to form her
                        opinion of him; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained
                        in the room; and even afterwards, so much were his spirits affected, she
                        could distinguish nothing but these words, in a whisper to Eleanor,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01735" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Frederick Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“How glad I shall be when you
                        are all off.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01736" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The bustle of going was not
                        pleasant. The clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down, and the
                        general had fixed to be out of Milsom Street by that hour.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01737" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_gen" data-placement="auto top">His greatcoat, instead of being
                        brought for him to put on directly, was spread out in the curricle in which
                        he was to accompany his son. The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn
                        out, though there were three people to go in it, and his daughter’s maid had
                        so crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to
                        sit;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01738" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">and, so much was he
                        influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in, that she had some
                        difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk from being thrown out into the
                        street. At last, however, the door was closed upon the three females, and
                        they set off at the sober pace in which the handsome, highly fed four horses
                        of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles: such was the
                        distance of Northanger from Bath, to be now divided into two equal stages.
                        Catherine’s spirits revived as they drove from the door; for with Miss
                        Tilney she felt no restraint; and, with the interest of a road entirely new
                        to her, of an abbey before, and a curricle behind, she caught the last view
                        of Bath without any regret, and met with every milestone before she expected
                        it. The tediousness of a two hours’ wait at Petty France, in which there was
                        nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry, and loiter about without
                        anything to see, next followed — and her admiration of the style in
                        which they travelled, of the fashionable chaise and four — postilions
                        handsomely liveried, rising so regularly in their stirrups, and numerous
                        outriders properly mounted, sunk a little under this consequent
                        inconvenience. Had their party been perfectly agreeable, the delay would
                        have been nothing; but General Tilney, though so charming a man, seemed
                        always a check upon his children’s spirits, and scarcely anything was said
                        but by himself; the observation of which, with his discontent at whatever
                        the inn afforded, and his angry impatience at the waiters, made Catherine
                        grow every moment more in awe of him, and appeared to lengthen the two hours
                        into four. At last, however, the order of release was given; and much was
                        Catherine then surprised by the general’s proposal of her taking his place
                        in his son’s curricle for the rest of the journey:</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01739" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_gen" data-placement="auto top">“the day was fine, and he was
                        anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01740" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The remembrance of Mr.
                        Allen’s opinion, respecting young men’s open carriages, made her blush at
                        the mention of such a plan, and her first thought was to decline it; but her
                        second was of greater deference for General Tilney’s judgment;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01741" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">he could not propose anything
                        improper for her;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01742" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">and, in the course of a few
                        minutes, she found herself with Henry in the curricle, as happy a being as
                        ever existed.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01743" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top"> A very short trial
                        convinced her that</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01744" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">a curricle was the prettiest
                        equipage in the world; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur,
                        to be sure, but it was a heavy and troublesome business,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01745" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she could not easily
                        forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France. Half the time would
                        have been enough for the curricle, and so nimbly were the light horses
                        disposed to move, that, had not the general chosen to have his own carriage
                        lead the way, they could have passed it with ease in half a minute. But the
                        merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01746" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">Henry drove so well — so
                        quietly — without making any disturbance, without parading to her, or
                        swearing at them:</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01747" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">so different from the only
                        gentleman-coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with!</span>

                        the innumerable capes of his greatcoat looked so becomingly important! To be
                        driven by him, next to being dancing with him, was certainly the greatest
                        happiness in the world.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01749" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">In addition to every other
                        delight, she had now that of listening to her own praise; of being thanked
                        at least, on his sister’s account, for her kindness in thus becoming her
                        visitor; of hearing it ranked as real friendship, and described as creating
                        real gratitude.</span>

                        — she had no female companion — and, in the frequent absence of
                        her father, was sometimes without any companion at all.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01753" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“But how can that

                            her?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01756" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“Northanger is not more than
                        half my home; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston, which is
                        nearly twenty miles from my father’s, and some of my time is necessarily
                        spent there.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01757" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“How sorry you must be for

                <p><span id="said_no_01759" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Yes; but besides your
                        affection for her, you must be so fond of the abbey! After being used to
                        such a home as the abbey, an ordinary parsonage-house must be very
                        disagreeable.”</span></p>

                <p>He smiled, and said, <span id="said_no_01760" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“You
                            have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01761" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“To be sure, I have. Is not it
                        a fine old place, just like what one reads about?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01762" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“And are you prepared to
                        encounter all the horrors that a building such as ‘what one reads about’ may
                        produce? Have you a stout heart? Nerves fit for sliding panels and
                        tapestry?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01763" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! yes — I do not
                        think I should be easily frightened, because there would be so many people
                        in the house — and besides, it has never been uninhabited and left
                        deserted for years, and then the family come back to it unawares, without
                        giving any notice, as generally happens.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01764" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“No, certainly. We shall not
                        have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of
                        a wood fire — nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room
                        without windows, doors, or furniture. But you must be aware that when a
                        young lady is (by whatever means) introduced into a dwelling of this kind,
                        she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family. While they snugly
                        repair to their own end of the house, she is formally conducted by Dorothy,
                        the ancient housekeeper, up a different staircase, and along many gloomy
                        passages, into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it
                        about twenty years before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not
                        your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber —
                        too lofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp
                        to take in its size — its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures
                        as large as life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet,
                        presenting even a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within
                        you?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01765" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! But this will not happen
                        to me, I am sure.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01766" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“How fearfully will you
                        examine the furniture of your apartment! And what will you discern? Not
                        tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers, but on one side perhaps the
                        remains of a broken lute, on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts
                        can open, and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior,
                        whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be
                        able to withdraw your eyes from it. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by
                        your appearance, gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few
                        unintelligible hints. To raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason
                        to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted,
                        and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call. With
                        this parting cordial she curtsies off — you listen to the sound of her
                        receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you — and when,
                        with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover, with
                        increased alarm, that it has no lock.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01767" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! Mr. Tilney, how
                        frightful! This is just like a book! But it cannot really happen to me. I am
                        sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy. Well, what then?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01768" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“Nothing further to alarm
                        perhaps may occur the first night. After surmounting your unconquerable
                        horror of the bed, you will retire to rest, and get a few hours’ unquiet
                        slumber. But on the second, or at farthest the third night after your
                        arrival, you will probably have a violent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as
                        to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the
                        neighbouring mountains — and during the frightful gusts of wind which
                        accompany it, you will probably think you discern (for your lamp is not
                        extinguished) one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest.
                        Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for
                        indulging it, you will instantly arise, and throwing your dressing-gown
                        around you, proceed to examine this mystery. After a very short search, you
                        will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy
                        the minutest inspection, and on opening it, a door will immediately appear
                        — which door, being only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you
                        will, after a few efforts, succeed in opening — and, with your lamp in
                        your hand, will pass through it into a small vaulted room.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01769" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“No, indeed; I should be too
                        much frightened to do any such thing.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01770" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“What! Not when Dorothy has
                        given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication
                        between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles
                        off? Could you shrink from so simple an adventure? No, no, you will proceed
                        into this small vaulted room, and through this into several others, without
                        perceiving anything very remarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a
                        dagger, in another a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some
                        instrument of torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common
                        way, and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own
                        apartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your eyes
                        will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold,
                        which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you had passed
                        unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will eagerly
                        advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search into every drawer
                        — but for some time without discovering anything of importance —
                        perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. At last, however, by
                        touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will open — a roll of
                        paper appears — you seize it — it contains many sheets of
                        manuscript — you hasten with the precious treasure into your own
                        chamber, but scarcely have you been able to decipher ‘Oh! Thou —
                        whomsoever thou mayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched
                        Matilda may fall’ — when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and
                        leaves you in total darkness.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01772" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">But Henry was too much amused
                        by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther; he could no

                        entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of Matilda’s woes.
                        Catherine, recollecting herself, grew ashamed of her eagerness, and began

                <p><span id="said_no_01776" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">As they drew near the end of
                        their journey, her impatience for a sight of the abbey — for some time
                        suspended by his conversation on subjects very different — returned in
                        full force, and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to
                        afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone, rising amidst a grove of
                        ancient oaks, with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour
                        on its high Gothic windows. But so low did the building stand, that she
                        found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very
                        grounds of Northanger, without having discerned even an antique
                        chimney.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01777" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">She knew not that she had any
                        right to be surprised, but there was a something in this mode of approach
                        which she certainly had not expected. To pass between lodges of a modern
                        appearance, to find herself with such ease in the very precincts of the
                        abbey, and driven so rapidly along a smooth, level road of fine gravel,
                        without obstacle, alarm, or solemnity of any kind, struck her as odd and
                        inconsistent. She was not long at leisure, however, for such considerations.
                        A sudden scud of rain, driving full in her face, made it impossible for her
                        to observe anything further, and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of
                        her new straw bonnet; and she was actually under the abbey walls, was
                        springing, with Henry’s assistance, from the carriage, was beneath the
                        shelter of the old porch, and had even passed on to the hall, where her
                        friend and the general were waiting to welcome her, without feeling one
                        awful foreboding of future misery to herself, or one moment’s suspicion of
                        any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice. The breeze
                        had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her; it had wafted
                        nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a good shake to
                        her habit, she was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room, and
                        capable of considering where she was.</span></p>

                        looked round the room, whether anything within her observation would have
                        given her the consciousness. The furniture was in all the profusion and
                        elegance of modern taste. The fireplace, where she had expected the ample
                        width and ponderous carving of former times, was contracted to a Rumford,
                        with slabs of plain though handsome marble, and ornaments over it of the
                        prettiest English china. The windows, to which she looked with peculiar
                        dependence, from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in
                        their Gothic form with reverential care, were yet less what her fancy had
                        portrayed.</span>
