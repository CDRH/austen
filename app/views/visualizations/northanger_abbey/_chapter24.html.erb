                <p><span id="said_no_02097" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The next day afforded no
                        opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments. It
                        was Sunday, and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was
                        required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home; and
                        great as was Catherine’s curiosity, her courage was not equal to a wish of
                        exploring them after dinner, either by the fading light of the sky between
                        six and seven o’clock, or by the yet more partial though stronger
                        illumination of a treacherous lamp. The day was unmarked therefore by
                        anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant
                        monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney, which immediately fronted the family
                        pew. By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal
                        of the highly strained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her by
                        the inconsolable husband,</span>

                        other her destroyer,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02099" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">affected her even to
                        tears.</span></p>

                        such a monument, should be able to face it, was not perhaps very strange,
                        and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view, maintain so
                        elevated an air, look so fearlessly around, nay, that he should even enter
                        the church,</span>

                        of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced.</span>

                        possible vice, going on from crime to crime, murdering whomsoever they
                        chose, without any feeling of humanity or remorse; till a violent death or a
                        religious retirement closed their black career. The erection of the monument
                        itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney’s
                        actual decease. Were she even to descend into the family vault where her
                        ashes were supposed to slumber, were she to behold the coffin in which they
                        were said to be enclosed — what could it avail in such a case?</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02105" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine had read too much
                        not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be
                        introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried on.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02106" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The succeeding morning
                        promised something better. The general’s early walk, ill-timed as it was in
                        every other view, was favourable here; and when she knew him to be out of
                        the house, she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her
                        promise. Eleanor was ready to oblige her; and Catherine reminding her as
                        they went of another promise, their first visit in consequence was to the
                        portrait in her bed-chamber. It represented a very lovely woman, with a mild
                        and pensive countenance, justifying, so far, the expectations of its new
                        observer; but they were not in every respect answered, for Catherine had
                        depended upon meeting with features, hair, complexion, that should be the
                        very counterpart, the very image, if not of Henry’s, of Eleanor’s —
                        the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking, bearing
                        always an equal resemblance of mother and child. A face once taken was taken
                        for generations. But here she was obliged to look and consider and study for
                        a likeness. She contemplated it, however, in spite of this drawback, with
                        much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest, would have left it
                        unwillingly.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02107" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her agitation as they entered
                        the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse; she could
                        only look at her companion. Eleanor’s countenance was dejected, yet sedate;
                        and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they
                        were advancing. Again she passed through the folding doors, again her hand
                        was upon the important lock, and Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was
                        turning to close the former with fearful caution, when the figure, the
                        dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery,
                        stood before her!</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02108" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The name of</span>

                        same moment, in his loudest tone, resounded through the building, giving to
                        his daughter the first intimation of his presence, and to Catherine terror
                        upon terror. An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive
                        movement on perceiving him, yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his
                        eye; and when her friend, who with an apologizing look darted hastily by
                        her, had joined and disappeared with him, she ran for safety to her own
                        room, and, locking herself in, believed that she should never have courage
                        to go down again.
                    <span id="said_no_02110" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">She remained there at least
                        an hour, in the greatest agitation, deeply commiserating the state of her
                        poor friend, and expecting a summons herself from the angry general to
                        attend him in his own apartment. No summons, however, arrived; and at last,
                        on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey, she was emboldened to descend
                        and meet him under the protection of visitors. The breakfast-room was gay
                        with company; and</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02114" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">in a complimentary style,
                        which so well concealed his resentful ire, as to make her feel secure at
                        least of life for the present.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02115" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">And Eleanor, with a
                            command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his
                            character, taking an early occasion of saying to her,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_02116" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eleanor Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“My father only wanted me

                            she had either been unseen by the general, or that from some
                            consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself
                            so.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02118" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Upon this trust she dared
                        still to remain in his presence, after the company left them, and nothing
                        occurred to disturb it.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02119" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">In the course of this
                        morning’s reflections, she came to a resolution of making her next attempt
                        on the forbidden door alone.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02120" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_9" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">It would be much better in every
                        respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter. To involve her in
                        the danger of a second detection, to court her into an apartment which must
                        wring her heart, could not be the office of a friend. The general’s utmost
                        anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter; and,
                        besides,</span>

                        more satisfactory if made without any companion. It would be impossible to
                        explain to Eleanor the suspicions, from which the other had, in all
                        likelihood, been hitherto happily exempt; nor could she therefore, in her
                        presence, search for those proofs of the general’s cruelty, which however
                        they might yet have escaped discovery, she felt confident of somewhere
                        drawing forth, in the shape of some fragmented journal, continued to the
                        last gasp.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02123" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Of the way to the apartment
                        she was now perfectly mistress; and as she wished to get it over before
                        Henry’s return, who was expected on the morrow, there was no time to be
                        lost. The day was bright, her courage high; at four o’clock, the sun was now
                        two hours above the horizon, and it would be only her retiring to dress half
                        an hour earlier than usual.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02124" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was done; and Catherine
                        found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike.
                        It was no time for thought; she hurried on, slipped with the least possible
                        noise through the folding doors, and without stopping to look or breathe,
                        rushed forward to the one in question. The lock yielded to her hand, and,
                        luckily, with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being. On tiptoe she
                        entered; the room was before her; but it was some minutes before she could
                        advance another step. She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated
                        every feature. She saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome
                        dimity bed, arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid’s care, a bright Bath
                        stove, mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the warm
                        beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows! Catherine had
                        expected to have her feelings worked, and worked they were. Astonishment and
                        doubt first seized them; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added
                        some bitter emotions of shame.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02125" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top">She could not be mistaken as to
                        the room; but how grossly mistaken in everything else! — in Miss
                        Tilney’s meaning, in her own calculation!</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02126" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">This apartment, to which she
                        had given a date so ancient, a position so awful, proved to be one end of
                        what the general’s father had built. There were two other doors in the
                        chamber, leading probably into dressing-closets; but she had no inclination
                        to open either.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02127" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar_cat" data-placement="auto top"> Would the veil in which Mrs.
                        Tilney had last walked, or the volume in which she had last read, remain to
                        tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper? No: whatever might have been
                        the general’s crimes, he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for
                        detection.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02128" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was sick of exploring,
                        and desired but to be safe in her own room, with her own heart only privy to
                        its folly; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had
                        entered, when the sound of footsteps, she could hardly tell where, made her
                        pause and tremble. To be found there, even by a servant, would be
                        unpleasant; but by the general (and he seemed always at hand when least
                        wanted), much worse! She listened — the sound had ceased; and
                        resolving not to lose a moment, she passed through and closed the door. At
                        that instant a door underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed with swift
                        steps to ascend the stairs, by the head of which she had yet to pass before
                        she could gain the gallery. She had no power to move. With a feeling of
                        terror not very definable, she fixed her eyes on the staircase, and in a few
                        moments it gave Henry to her view.</span>

                            of more than common astonishment. He looked astonished too.</span>
