                <p><span id="said_no_01137" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The next morning was fair,
                        and Catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled party. With
                        Mr. Allen to support her, she felt no dread of the event: but she would
                        gladly be spared a contest, where victory itself was painful, and was
                        heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them.
                        The Tilneys called for her at the appointed time; and no new difficulty
                        arising, no sudden recollection, no unexpected summons, no impertinent
                        intrusion to disconcert their measures, my heroine was most unnaturally able
                        to fulfil her engagement, though it was made with the hero himself. They
                        determined on walking round Beechen Cliff, that noble hill whose beautiful
                        verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object from almost
                        every opening in Bath.</span></p>

                            walked along the side of the river,</span>

                        have read about. It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her
                        father travelled through, in The Mysteries of Udolpho. But you never read
                        novels, I dare say?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01144" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“Why not?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01145" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Because they are not clever
                        enough for you — gentlemen read better books.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01146" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“The person, be it gentleman
                        or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid. I
                        have read all Mrs. Radcliffe’s works, and most of them with great pleasure.
                        The Mysteries of Udolpho, when I had once begun it, I could not lay down
                        again; I remember finishing it in two days — my hair standing on end
                        the whole time.”</span></p>

                        <span id="said_no_01149" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eleanor Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“and I remember that you
                            undertook to read it aloud to me, and that when I was called away for
                            only five minutes to answer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took
                            the volume into the Hermitage Walk, and I was obliged to stay till you
                            had finished it.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01150" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“Thank you, Eleanor — a
                        most honourable testimony. You see, Miss Morland, the injustice of your
                        suspicions. Here was I, in my eagerness to get on, refusing to wait only
                        five minutes for my sister, breaking the promise I had made of reading it
                        aloud, and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part, by running
                        away with the volume, which, you are to observe, was her own, particularly
                        her own. I am proud when I reflect on it, and I think it must establish me
                        in your good opinion.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01151" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“I am very glad to hear it
                        indeed, and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself. But I
                        really thought before, young men despised novels amazingly.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01152" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“It is amazingly; it may well
                        suggest amazement if they do — for they read nearly as many as women.
                        I myself have read hundreds and hundreds. Do not imagine that you can cope
                        with me in a knowledge of Julias and Louisas. If we proceed to particulars,
                        and engage in the never-ceasing inquiry of ‘Have you read this?’ and ‘Have
                        you read that?’ I shall soon leave you as far behind me as — what
                        shall I say? — I want an appropriate simile. — as far as your
                        friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into
                        Italy. Consider how many years I have had the start of you. I had entered on
                        my studies at Oxford, while you were a good little girl working your sampler
                        at home!”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01153" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Not very good, I am afraid.
                        But now really, do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the
                        world?”</span></p>

                            language, and now he is taking the same liberty with you. The word
                            ‘nicest,’ as you used it, did not suit him; and you had better change it
                            as soon as you can, or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair

                            Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness, propriety,
                            delicacy, or refinement — people were nice in their dress, in
                            their sentiments, or their choice. But now every commendation on every

                            in the utmost propriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever
                            terms we like best. It is a most interesting work. You are fond of that

                        real solemn history, I cannot be interested in. Can you?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01170" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eleanor Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, I am fond of

                        a little as a duty, but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or
                        weary me. The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in
                        every page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all
                        — it is very tiresome: and yet I often think it odd that it should be
                        so dull, for a great deal of it must be invention. The speeches that are put
                        into the heroes’ mouths, their thoughts and designs — the chief of all
                        this must be invention, and invention is what delights me in other
                        books.”</span></p>

                            am fond of history — and am very well contented to take the false
                            with the true. In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence
                            in former histories and records, which may be as much depended on, I
                            conclude, as anything that does not actually pass under one’s own
                            observation; and as for the little embellishments you speak of, they are
                            embellishments, and I like them as such. If a speech be well drawn up, I
                            read it with pleasure, by whomsoever it may be made — and probably
                            with much greater, if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson, than
                            if the genuine words of Caractacus, Agricola, or Alfred the

                        it. So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable! At
                        this rate, I shall not pity the writers of history any longer. If people
                        like to read their books, it is all very well, but to be at so much trouble
                        in filling great volumes, which, as I used to think, nobody would willingly
                        ever look into, to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and
                        girls, always struck me as a hard fate; and though I know it is all very
                        right and necessary, I have often wondered at the person’s courage that

                            behalf of our most distinguished historians, I must observe that they
                            might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim, and that
                            by their method and style, they are perfectly well qualified to torment
                            readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life. I use the
                            verb ‘to torment,’ as I observed to be your own method, instead of ‘to
                            instruct,’ supposing them to be now admitted as
                        synonymous.”</span></p>

                        instruction a torment, but if you had been as much used as myself to hear
                        poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to
                        spell, if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning
                        together, and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it, as I am in the
                        habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home, you would allow that
                        ‘to torment’ and ‘to instruct’ might sometimes be used as synonymous
                        words.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01180" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“Very probably. But historians
                        are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read; and even you
                        yourself, who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe,
                        very intense application, may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is
                        very well worth-while to be tormented for two or three years of one’s life,
                        for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it. Consider — if
                        reading had not been taught, Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain

                        and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady’s merits closed the subject.
                        The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on which she had nothing to say.
                        They were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to
                        drawing, and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures, with
                        all the eagerness of real taste. Here Catherine was quite lost. She knew
                        nothing of drawing — nothing of taste: and she listened to them with
                        an attention which brought her little profit, for they talked in phrases
                        which conveyed scarcely any idea to her. The little which she could
                        understand, however, appeared to contradict the very few notions she had
                        entertained on the matter before.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01183" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was heartily ashamed of
                        her ignorance. A misplaced shame. Where people wish to attach, they should
                        always be ignorant. To come with a well-informed mind is to come with an
                        inability of administering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person
                        would always wish to avoid. A woman especially, if she have the misfortune
                        of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can.</span></p>

                        justice to men, that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex,
                        imbecility in females is a great enhancement of their personal charms, there
                        is a portion of them too reasonable and too well informed themselves to
                        desire anything more in woman than ignorance. But Catherine did not know her
                        own advantages — did not know that a good-looking girl, with an
                        affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a

                        Delighted with her progress, and fearful of wearying her with too much
                        wisdom at once, Henry suffered the subject to decline, and by an easy
