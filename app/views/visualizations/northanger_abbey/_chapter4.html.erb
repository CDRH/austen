                        eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump-room the next day, secure within
                        herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning were over, and ready
                        to meet him with a smile; but no smile was demanded — Mr. Tilney did
                        not appear. Every creature in Bath, except himself, was to be seen in the
                        room at different periods of the fashionable hours; crowds of people were
                        every moment passing in and out, up the steps and down; people whom nobody
                        cared about, and nobody wanted to see; and he only was absent.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00163" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“What a delightful
                            place Bath is,”</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00164" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">said Mrs. Allen as they
                            sat down near the great clock, after parading the room till they were
                            tired;</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00165" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“and how pleasant it
                            would be if we had any acquaintance here.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00166" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">This sentiment had been
                            uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no particular reason to
                            hope it would be followed with more advantage now; but we are told to
                            “despair of nothing we would attain,” as “unwearied diligence our point
                            would gain”; and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day
                            wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward, for
                            hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own
                            age, who was sitting by her, and had been looking at her attentively for
                            several minutes, addressed her with great complaisance in these
                            words:</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00167" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“I think, madam, I
                            cannot be mistaken; it is a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing
                            you, but is not your name Allen?”</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00168" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">This question answered, as
                        it readily was,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00169" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">the stranger pronounced
                        hers to be</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00171" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">and Mrs. Allen immediately
                        recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had
                        seen only once since their respective marriages, and that many years ago.
                        Their joy on this meeting was very great, as well it might, since they had
                        been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years.
                        Compliments on good looks now passed; and, after</span>

                        slipped away since they were last together, how little they had thought of
                        meeting in Bath, and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00174" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">they proceeded to make
                        inquiries and give intelligence as to their families, sisters, and cousins,
                        talking both together, far more ready to give than to receive information,
                        and each hearing very little of what the other said. Mrs. Thorpe, however,
                        had one great advantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen, in a family of
                        children; and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons, and the beauty
                        of her daughters, when she related their different situations and views
                        — that John was at Oxford, Edward at Merchant Taylors’, and William at
                        sea — and all of them more beloved and respected in their different
                        station than any other three beings ever were, Mrs. Allen had no similar
                        information to give, no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and
                        unbelieving ear of her friend, and was forced to sit and appear to listen to
                        all these maternal effusions, consoling herself, however, with the
                        discovery, which her keen eye soon made, that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe’s
                        pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00175" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Here come my dear

                            pointing at three smart-looking females who, arm in arm, were then
                            moving towards her.</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00177" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“My dear Mrs. Allen, I
                            long to introduce them; they will be so delighted to see you: the
                            tallest is Isabella, my eldest; is not she a fine young woman? The
                            others are very much admired too, but I believe Isabella is the
                            handsomest.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00178" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Miss Thorpes were
                        introduced; and Miss Morland, who had been for a short time forgotten, was
                        introduced likewise.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00179" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The name seemed to
                            strike them all; and, after speaking to her with great civility, the
                            eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00180" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“How excessively like her

                        surprised; but Mrs. Thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history
                        of their acquaintance with Mr. James Morland, before</span>

                        formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college, of the name of

                        many obliging things were said by </span>

                        acquainted with her; of being considered as already friends, through the
                        friendship of their brothers, etc.,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00194" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">which Catherine heard with
                        pleasure, and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command;
                        and, as the first proof of amity, she was soon invited to accept an arm of
                        the eldest Miss Thorpe, and take a turn with her about the room. Catherine
                        was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance, and almost
                        forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe. Friendship is certainly
                        the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00195" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Their conversation turned
                        upon those subjects, of which the free discussion has generally much to do
                        in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies: such as dress,
                        balls, flirtations, and quizzes. Miss Thorpe, however, being four years
                        older than Miss Morland, and at least four years better informed, had a very
                        decided advantage in discussing such points; she could compare the balls of
                        Bath with those of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London;
                        could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful
                        attire; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only
                        smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd.
                        These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom they were
                        entirely new; and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been
                        too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe’s manners,
                        and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her,
                        softened down every feeling of awe, and left nothing but tender affection.
                        Their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns
                        in the pump-room, but required, when they all quitted it together, that Miss
                        Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen’s house;
                        and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened
                        shake of hands, after learning, to their mutual relief, that they should see
                        each other across the theatre at night, and say their prayers in the same
                        chapel the next morning. Catherine then ran directly upstairs, and watched
                        Miss Thorpe’s progress down the street from the drawing-room window; admired
                        the graceful spirit of her walk, the fashionable air of her figure and
                        dress; and felt grateful, as well she might, for the chance which had
                        procured her such a friend.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00196" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Thorpe was a widow, and
                        not a very rich one; she was a good-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very
                        indulgent mother. Her eldest daughter had great personal beauty, and the
                        younger ones, by pretending to be as handsome as their sister, imitating her
                        air, and dressing in the same style, did very well.</span></p>

                        family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail
                        from Mrs. Thorpe herself, of her past adventures and sufferings, which might
                        otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters; in
                        which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth, and
                        conversations, which had passed twenty years before, be minutely
                        repeated.</span></p>
