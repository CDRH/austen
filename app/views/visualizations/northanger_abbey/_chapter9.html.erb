                <p><span id="said_no_00500" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">The progress of Catherine’s
                        unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows. It appeared first
                        in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her, while she remained in
                        the rooms, which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent
                        desire to go home. This, on arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction
                        of extraordinary hunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an earnest
                        longing to be in bed; such was the extreme point of her distress; for when
                        there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours, and
                        from which she awoke perfectly revived, in excellent spirits, with fresh
                        hopes and fresh schemes. The first wish of her heart was to improve her
                        acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and almost her first resolution, to seek her
                        for that purpose, in the pump-room at noon. In the pump-room, one so newly
                        arrived in Bath must be met with, and that building she had already found so
                        favourable for the discovery of female excellence, and the completion of
                        female intimacy, so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited
                        confidence, that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend
                        from within its walls. Her plan for the morning thus settled, she sat
                        quietly down to her book after breakfast,</span>

                        little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose
                        vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such, that as she never
                        talked a great deal, so she could never be entirely silent; and, therefore,
                        while she sat at her work, if she lost her needle or broke her thread, if
                        she heard a carriage in the street, or saw a speck upon her gown, she must
                        observe it aloud, whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or
                        not.</span>

                            twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window, and
                            scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open
                            carriages at the door, in the first only a servant, her brother driving
                            Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe came running upstairs,
                            calling out,</span>

                            here I am. Have you been waiting long? We could not come before; the old
                            devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be
                            got into, and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before
                            we are out of the street. How do you do, Mrs. Allen? A famous ball last
                            night, was not it? Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a
                            confounded hurry to be off. They want to get their tumble
                        over.”</span></p>

                            by a look, was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else;

                            the most placid indifference. Catherine took the advice, and ran off to
                            get ready. In a very few minutes she reappeared, having scarcely allowed
                            the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her
                            praise, after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen’s admiration of his gig;
                            and then receiving her friend’s parting good wishes, they both hurried
                            downstairs.</span>

                            know his master. He is full of spirits, playful as can be, but there is
                            no vice in him.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00532" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine did not think the
                        portrait a very inviting one, but it was too late to retreat, and she was
                        too young to own herself frightened; so, resigning herself to her fate, and
                        trusting to the animal’s boasted knowledge of its owner, she sat peaceably
                        down, and saw Thorpe sit down by her.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00533" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Everything being then
                            arranged, the servant who stood at the horse’s head was bid in an
                            important voice</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00534" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="John Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“to let him go,”</span>

                            quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a caper, or anything
                            like one.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00536" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine, delighted at so
                        happy an escape, spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and her
                        companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that
                        it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had
                        then held the reins, and the singular discernment and dexterity with which
                        he had directed his whip. Catherine, though she could not help wondering
                        that with such perfect command of his horse, he should think it necessary to
                        alarm her with a relation of its tricks, congratulated herself sincerely on
                        being under the care of so excellent a coachman; and perceiving that the
                        animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner, without showing the
                        smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity, and (considering its
                        inevitable pace was ten miles an hour) by no means alarmingly fast, gave
                        herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating
                        kind, in a fine mild day of February, with the consciousness of
                        safety.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00537" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">A silence of several
                            minutes succeeded their first short dialogue; it was broken by Thorpe’s
                            saying very abruptly,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_00538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="John Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Old Allen is as rich as
                            a Jew — is not he?” Catherine did not understand him — and
                            he repeated his question, adding in explanation, “Old Allen, the man you
                            are with.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00539" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! Mr. Allen, you mean. Yes,
                        I believe, he is very rich.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00540" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="John Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“And no children at

                <p><span id="said_no_00545" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, very much.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00546" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="John Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Aye, that is what I meant.
                        He seems a good kind of old fellow enough, and has lived very well in his
                        time, I dare say; he is not gouty for nothing. Does he drink his bottle a
                        day now?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00547" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“His bottle a day! No. Why
                        should you think of such a thing? He is a very temperate man, and you could
                        not fancy him in liquor last night?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00548" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="John Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Lord help you! You women are
                        always thinking of men’s being in liquor. Why, you do not suppose a man is
                        overset by a bottle? I am sure of this — that if everybody was to
                        drink their bottle a day, there would not be half the disorders in the world

                        was reckoned a remarkable thing, at the last party in my rooms, that upon an
                        average we cleared about five pints a head. It was looked upon as something
                        out of the common way. Mine is famous good stuff, to be sure. You would not
                        often meet with anything like it in Oxford — and that may account for

                <p><span id="said_no_00606" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, I went to the pump-room
                        as soon as you were gone, and there I met her, and we had a great deal of
                        talk together.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00607" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">She says</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00608" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen speaking as Mrs. Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">there was hardly any
                        veal to be got at market this morning, it is so uncommonly

                <p><span id="said_no_00610" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“Yes; we agreed to take a
                        turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs. Hughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney
                        walking with her.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00611" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Did you indeed? And did they
                        speak to you?”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00612" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“Yes, we walked along the
                        Crescent together for half an hour. They seem very agreeable people. Miss
                        Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin, and I fancy, by what I can
                        learn, that she always dresses very handsomely. Mrs. Hughes talked to me a
                        great deal about the family.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00613" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“And what did she tell you of

                <p><span id="said_no_00614" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">“Oh! A vast deal indeed; she
                        hardly talked of anything else.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00615" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Did she tell you what part of

                        recollect now. But they are very good kind of people, and very rich.</span>

                        Miss Drummond, and she and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows; and Miss Drummond
                        had a very large fortune; and, when she married, her father gave her twenty
                        thousand pounds, and five hundred to buy wedding-clothes. Mrs. Hughes saw
                        all the clothes after they came from the warehouse.”</span></p>

                        am not quite certain. Upon recollection, however, I have a notion they are
                        both dead; at least the mother is; yes, I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead,
                        because</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00620" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Allen" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Hughes told me</span>

                        beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her
                        wedding-day and that Miss Tilney has got now, for they were put by for her
                        when her mother died.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00627" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine inquired no
                        further; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real
                        intelligence to give, and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself
                        in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister. Could she have
                        foreseen such a circumstance, nothing should have persuaded her to go out
                        with the others; and, as it was, she could only lament her ill luck, and
                        think over what she had lost, till it was clear to her that the drive had by
                        no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite
                        disagreeable.</span></p>
