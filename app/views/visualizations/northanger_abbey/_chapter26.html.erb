                        was frequently canvassed by the three young people; and Catherine found,
                        with some surprise, that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in
                        considering Isabella’s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw
                        great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother. Their
                        persuasion that the general would, upon this ground alone, independent of
                        the objection that might be raised against her character, oppose the
                        connection, turned her feelings moreover with some alarm towards
                        herself.</span>

                        perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir of the Tilney property
                        had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself, at what point of interest
                        were the demands of his younger brother to rest?</span>

                        partiality, which, as she was given to understand by his words as well as
                        his actions, she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the
                        general;</span>

                        matters misunderstood by his children.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02298" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">They were so fully convinced,
                        however, that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person
                        for his father’s consent, and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in
                        his life been less likely to come to Northanger than at the present time,
                        that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden
                        removal of her own.</span>

                        any just idea of Isabella’s conduct,</span>

                        lay the whole business before him as it really was, enabling the general by

                        on a fairer ground than inequality of situations.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02302" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">She proposed it to him
                        accordingly; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had
                        expected.</span>

                        to think. Sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the
                        natural result of the suspected engagement, and at others that it was wholly
                        incompatible with it.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02327" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Henry was greatly honoured
                        and very happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme.</span>

                        attend the parish meeting, and shall probably be obliged to stay two or
                        three days.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02329" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="General Tilney" data-placement="auto top">“Well, well, we will take our
                        chance some one of those days. There is no need to fix. You are not to put
                        yourself at all out of your way. Whatever you may happen to have in the
                        house will be enough. I think I can answer for the young ladies making
                        allowance for a bachelor’s table. Let me see; Monday will be a busy day with
                        you, we will not come on Monday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me. I
                        expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning; and
                        afterwards I cannot in decency fail attending the club. I really could not
                        face my acquaintance if I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the
                        country, it would be taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me, Miss
                        Morland, never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small sacrifice
                        of time and attention can prevent it. They are a set of very worthy men.
                        They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I dine with them
                        whenever I can. Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of the question. But
                        on Wednesday, I think, Henry, you may expect us; and we shall be with you
                        early, that we may have time to look about us. Two hours and three quarters
                        will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall be in the carriage by ten;
                        so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday, you may look for
                    us.”</span></p>

                            still bounding with joy when Henry, about an hour afterwards, came
                            booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting,

                            disadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the
                            future, that may not be honoured. Witness myself, at this present hour.
                            Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on

                        besides, if he had not said half so much as he did, he has always such an

                        however disagreeable to her his going. But the inexplicability of the

                    <span id="said_no_02351" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was tired of the woods
                        and the shrubberies — always so smooth and so dry; and the abbey in
                        itself was no more to her now than any other house. The painful remembrance
                        of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which
                        could spring from a consideration of the building.</span>

                        She, who had so longed to be in an abbey! Now, there was nothing so charming
                        to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connected
                        parsonage, something like Fullerton, but better: Fullerton had its faults,
                        but Woodston probably had none. If Wednesday should ever come!</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02353" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">It did come, and exactly when
                        it might be reasonably looked for. It came — it was fine — and
                        Catherine trod on air. By ten o’clock, the chaise and four conveyed the two
                        from the abbey; and, after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles, they
                        entered Woodston, a large and populous village, in a situation not
                        unpleasant. Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it, as the
                        general seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the
                        country, and the size of the village; but in her heart she preferred it to
                        any place she had ever been at, and looked with great admiration at every
                        neat house above the rank of a cottage, and at all the little chandler’s
                        shops which they passed. At the further end of the village, and tolerably
                        disengaged from the rest of it, stood the parsonage, a new-built substantial
                        stone house, with its semicircular sweep and green gates; and, as they drove
                        up to the door, Henry, with the friends of his solitude, a large
                        Newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers, was ready to receive and make
                        much of them.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02354" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine’s mind was too
                        full, as she entered the house, for her either to observe or to say a great
                        deal; and, till called on by the general for her opinion of it, she had very
                        little idea of the room in which she was sitting. Upon looking round it
                        then,</span>

                        say so, and the coldness of her praise disappointed him.</span></p>

                            habitable; and altogether not inferior to the generality; or, in other
                            words, I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so
                            good. It may admit of improvement, however. Far be it from me to say
                            otherwise; and anything in reason — a bow thrown out, perhaps
                            — though, between ourselves, if there is one thing more than

                        shortly restored to his complacency, and Catherine to all her usual ease of

                        shown, first into a smaller apartment, belonging peculiarly to the master of
                        the house, and made unusually tidy on the occasion; and afterwards into what
                        was to be the drawing-room, with the appearance of which, though
                        unfurnished, Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general. It
                        was a prettily shaped room, the windows reaching to the ground, and the view
                        from them pleasant, though only over green meadows; and she expressed her
                        admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt
