                            Morlands all met in the evening at the theatre; and, as Catherine and
                            Isabella sat together, there was then an opportunity for the latter to
                            utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting
                            within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which
                            had divided them.</span>

                            another word to you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you not to
                            expect it. My sweetest Catherine, how have you been this long age? But I
                            need not ask you, for you look delightfully. You really have done your
                            hair in a more heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do
                            you want to attract everybody? I assure you, my brother is quite in love
                            with you already; and as for Mr. Tilney — but that is a settled
                            thing — even your modesty cannot doubt his attachment now; his
                            coming back to Bath makes it too plain. Oh! What would not I give to see
                            him! I really am quite wild with impatience.</span>

                            sake! I assure you, I can hardly exist till I see him.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00637" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“No,”</span>

                            see him anywhere.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00640" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Oh, horrid! Am I never to be
                        acquainted with him? How do you like my gown? I think it does not look
                        amiss; the sleeves were entirely my own thought. Do you know, I get so
                        immoderately sick of Bath; your brother and I were agreeing this morning
                        that, though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks, we would not live
                        here for millions. We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in
                        preferring the country to every other place; really, our opinions were so
                        exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous! There was not a single point in
                        which we differed; I would not have had you by for the world; you are such a
                        sly thing, I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about
                        it.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00641" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“No, indeed I should
                        not.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00642" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Isabella Thorpe" data-placement="auto top">“Oh, yes you would indeed; I
                        know you better than you know yourself. You would have told us that we
                        seemed born for each other, or some nonsense of that kind, which would have
                        distressed me beyond conception; my cheeks would have been as red as your
                        roses; I would not have had you by for the world.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00643" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Catherine Morland" data-placement="auto top">“Indeed you do me injustice; I
                        would not have made so improper a remark upon any account; and besides, I am
                        sure it would never have entered my head.”</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00644" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Isabella smiled incredulously
                        and talked the rest of the evening to James.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00645" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">Catherine’s resolution of
                        endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next
                        morning; and till the usual moment of going to the pump-room, she felt some
                        alarm from the dread of a second prevention. But nothing of that kind
                        occurred, no visitors appeared to delay them, and they all three set off in
                        good time for the pump-room, where the ordinary course of events and
                        conversation took place; Mr. Allen, after drinking his glass of water,
                        joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the
                        accounts of their newspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing
                        every new face, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of
                        the Thorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in
                        less than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took her usual
                        place by the side of her friend. James, who was now in constant attendance,
                        maintained a similar position, and separating themselves from the rest of
                        their party, they walked in that manner for some time, till Catherine began
                        to doubt the happiness of a situation which, confining her entirely to her
                        friend and brother, gave her very little share in the notice of either. They
                        were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute, but
                        their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity
                        attended with so much laughter, that though Catherine’s supporting opinion
                        was not unfrequently called for by one or the other, she was never able to
                        give any, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length however she
                        was empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowed necessity
                        of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw just entering the
                        room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, with a firmer
                        determination to be acquainted, than she might have had courage to command,
                        had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before. Miss Tilney
                        met her with great civility, returned her advances with equal goodwill, and
                        they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the
                        room; and though in all probability not an observation was made, nor an
                        expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of
                        times before, under that roof, in every Bath season, yet the merit of their
                        being spoken with simplicity and truth, and without personal conceit, might
                        be something uncommon.</span></p>

                        returned; and they parted — on Miss Tilney’s side with some knowledge
                        of her new acquaintance’s feelings, and on Catherine’s, without the smallest
                        consciousness of having explained them.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00673" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">She went home very happy. The
                        morning had answered all her hopes, and the evening of the following day was
                        now the object of expectation, the future good. What gown and what
                        head-dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern. She
                        cannot be justified in it. Dress is at all times a frivolous distinction,
                        and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim. Catherine knew
                        all this very well; her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject
                        only the Christmas before; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday
                        night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but
                        the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening.
                        This would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon, from
                        which one of the other sex rather than her own, a brother rather than a
                        great aunt, might have warned her, for man only can be aware of the
                        insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying to the
                        feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little the
                        heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire; how
                        little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how unsusceptible of
                        peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged, the mull, or the
                        jackonet. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire
                        her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion
                        are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will
                        be most endearing to the latter. But not one of these grave reflections
                        troubled the tranquillity of Catherine.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00674" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">She entered the rooms on
                        Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her
                        thither the Monday before. She had then been exulting in her engagement to
                        Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight, lest he should
                        engage her again; for though she could not, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney
                        should ask her a third time to dance, her wishes, hopes, and plans all
                        centred in nothing less. Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this
                        critical moment, for every young lady has at some time or other known the
                        same agitation. All have been, or at least all have believed themselves to
                        be, in danger from the pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all
                        have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please.
                        As soon as they were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine’s agony began; she
                        fidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her, hid herself as much as
                        possible from his view, and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him.
                        The cotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she saw nothing
                        of the Tilneys.</span></p>

                            forty guineas. I had fifty minds to buy it myself, for it is one of my

                            without injuring the rights of the other. I consider a country-dance as

                        allow, that in both, man has the advantage of choice, woman only the power
                        of refusal; that in both, it is an engagement between man and woman, formed
                        for the advantage of each; and that when once entered into, they belong
                        exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution; that it is
                        their duty, each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he
                        or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere, and their best interest to keep
                        their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their
                        neighbours, or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone
                        else. You will allow all this?”</span></p>

                        certainly is a difference. In marriage, the man is supposed to provide for
                        the support of the woman, the woman to make the home agreeable to the man;
                        he is to purvey, and she is to smile. But in dancing, their duties are
                        exactly changed; the agreeableness, the compliance are expected from him,
                        while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water. That, I suppose, was the
                        difference of duties which struck you, as rendering the conditions incapable
