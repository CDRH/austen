                <p><span id="said_no_00001" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.003.nar" data-placement="auto top">THIS little work was finished
                        in the year 1803, and intended for immediate publication. It was disposed of
                        to a bookseller, it was even advertised, and why the business proceeded no
                        farther, the author has never been able to learn. That any bookseller should
                        think it worth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while to
                        publish seems extraordinary. But with this, neither the author nor the
                        public have any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon
                        those parts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively
                        obsolete. The public are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen years have
                        passed since it was finished, many more since it was begun, and that during
                        that period, places, manners, books, and opinions have undergone
                        considerable changes.</span></p>
