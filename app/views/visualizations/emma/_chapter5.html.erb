                        may be said to do Emma good. I have been seeing their intimacy with the
                        greatest pleasure. How very differently we feel!—</span>

                        beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr. Knightley."</span></p>

                        come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out, and that you
                        must still fight your own battle."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00260" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly
                        support me, if he were here, for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.
                        We were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for
                        Emma, that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate
                        with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.
                        You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a
                        companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman
                        feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to it all her
                        life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior
                        young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma
                        wants to see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read
                        more herself. They will read together. She means it, I know."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00261" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Emma has been meaning to
                        read more ever since she was twelve years old. I have seen a great many
                        lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read
                        regularly through— and very good lists they were —very well
                        chosen, and very neatly arranged— sometimes alphabetically, and
                        sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up when only fourteen—
                        I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it
                        some time; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now. But I
                        have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. She will
                        never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection
                        of the fancy to the understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I
                        may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.—You never could
                        persuade her to read half so much as you wished.—You know you could
                        not."</span></p>

                            charm thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and remember. Emma is
                            spoiled by being the cleverest of her family. At ten years old, she had
                            the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her
                            sister at seventeen. She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and
                            diffident. And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the
                            house and of you all. In her mother she lost the only person able to
                            cope with her. She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been
                            under subjection to her."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00270" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"I should have been sorry,
                        Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on <em>your</em>
                        recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another
                        situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any
                        body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I
                    held."</span></p>

                                <em>here</em>; very fit for a wife, but not at all for
                            a governess. But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all
                            the time you were at Hartfield. You might not give Emma such a complete
                            education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a
                            very good education from <em>her</em>, on the very
                            material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you
                            were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should
                            certainly have named Miss Taylor."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00274" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"Thank you. There will be
                        very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr.
                    Weston."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00275" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Why, to own the truth, I
                        am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to
                        bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We will not despair, however.
                        Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague
                        him."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00276" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"I hope not <em>that</em>.—It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not foretell
                        vexation from that quarter."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00277" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Not I, indeed. I only name
                        possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's genius for foretelling and
                        guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit,
                        and a Churchill in fortune.—But Harriet Smith—I have not half
                        done about Harriet Smith. I think her the very worst sort of companion that
                        Emma could possibly have. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as
                        knowing every thing. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the
                        worse, because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma
                        imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such
                        a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that <em>she</em> cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will
                        only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to. She
                        will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom
                        birth and circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's
                        doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt
                        herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.—They
                        only give a little polish."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00278" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"I either depend more upon
                        Emma's good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort;
                        for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How well she looked last
                        night!"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00279" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Oh! you would rather talk
                        of her person than her mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to
                        deny Emma's being pretty."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00280" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"Pretty! say beautiful
                        rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether
                        —face and figure?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00281" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"I do not know what I could
                        imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more
                        pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial old friend."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00282" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"Such an eye!—the true
                        hazle eye —and so brilliant! regular features, open countenance, with
                        a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and
                        size; such a firm and upright figure! There is health, not merely in her
                        bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child
                        being 'the picture of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being
                        the complete picture of grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr.
                        Knightley, is not she?"</span></p>

                            not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome she is, she
                            appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way. Mrs.
                            Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my
                            dread of its doing them both harm."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00286" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"And I, Mr. Knightley, am

                        Emma's little faults, she is an excellent creature. Where shall we see a
                        better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has
                        qualities which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong;
                        she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right
                        a hundred times."</span></p>

                        myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella. John loves Emma with a
                        reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks
                        as he does; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the
                        children. I am sure of having their opinions with me."</span></p>

                        privilege of speech that Emma's mother might have had) the liberty of
                        hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's
                        intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me;
                        but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy,
                        it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who
                        perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it
                        is a source of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to
                        give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little
