                        to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the evening. How it might be
                        considered by the rest of the party, she could not tell. They, in their
                        different homes, and their different ways, might be looking back on it with
                        pleasure; but</span>

                        it was a
                        morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational satisfaction
                        at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than any she had ever
                        passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father, was felicity to it.
                            <em>There</em>, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she
                        was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04180" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and feeling that, unmerited
                        as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could
                        not, in her general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.</span>

                        As a
                        daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart. She hoped no one could have
                        said to her, "How could you be so unfeeling to your father?—I must, I
                        will tell you truths while I can." Miss Bates should never again— no,
                        never! If attention, in future, could do away the past, she might hope to be
                        forgiven. She had been often remiss,</span>

                        remiss,
                        perhaps, more in thought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be
                        so no more. In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the
                        very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a
                        regular, equal, kindly intercourse.</span></p>

                        were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be ashamed of the
                        appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.</span>

                        of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04191" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was a bustle on her

                        she would be
                        pleased to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and
                        niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct
                        glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out,
                        she heard Miss Bates saying,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04194" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"Well, my dear, I shall <em>say</em> you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you
                        are ill enough."</span></p>

                        and humble as usual, looked as if she did not quite understand what was

                            will be here presently, Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish
                            Hetty had not gone. I am very little able —Have you a chair,
                            ma'am? Do you sit where you like? I am sure she will be here
                            presently."</span></p>

                        would. She had a moment's fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her. But Miss

                        her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before— less
                        ease of look and manner. A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she
                        hoped, might lead the way to a return of old feelings. The touch seemed
                        immediate.</span></p>

                            has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:—such
                            long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs.
                            Dixon. 'My dear,' said I, 'you will blind yourself'—for tears were
                            in her eyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a
                            great change; and though she is amazingly fortunate —such a
                            situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first
                            going out— do not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such
                            surprising good fortune—</span>

                            you were to see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you
                            know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low
                            as possible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy
                            she is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming
                            to you —she is not able— she is gone into her own room
                            —I want her to lie down upon the bed. 'My dear,' said I, 'I shall
                            say you are laid down upon the bed:' but, however, she is not; she is
                            walking about the room. But, now that she has written her

                            ashamed—but somehow there was a little bustle—for it so
                            happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the
                            stairs, we did not know any body was coming. 'It is only Mrs. Cole,'
                            said I, 'depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.'</span>

                        suspicion, and left her nothing but pity; and the remembrance of the less

                        might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend,

                        stay —no, it could not be before tea, because we were just going to
                        cards—and yet it was before tea, because I remember thinking—
                        Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened before tea, but
                        not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's
                        son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for him;
                        he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he
                        is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints—
                        I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out
                        at all. And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the
                        parish; he is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the
                        Crown, ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his
                        father without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what
                        John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise
                        having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That
                        was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs.
