                <p><span id="said_no_01618" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Jane Fairfax was an orphan,
                        the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest daughter.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01619" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The marriage of Lieut.
                        Fairfax of the ——regiment of infantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had
                        had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now
                        remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action
                        abroad—of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon
                        afterwards— and this girl.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01620" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">By birth she belonged to
                        Highbury: and when at three years old, on losing her mother, she became the
                        property, the charge, the consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and
                        aunt, there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed
                        there; of her being taught only what very limited means could command, and
                        growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted
                        on what nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and
                        warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01621" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">But the compassionate
                        feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny. This was
                        Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent
                        officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him
                        for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved
                        his life. These were claims which he did not learn to overlook, though some
                        years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to
                        England put any thing in his power. When he did return, he sought out the
                        child and took notice of her. He was a married man, with only one living
                        child, a girl, about Jane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them
                        long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years
                        old, his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real
                        friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the
                        whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and from that period Jane
                        had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely,
                        only visiting her grandmother from time to time.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01622" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The plan was that she should
                        be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she
                        inherited from her father making independence impossible. To provide for her
                        otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay
                        and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his
                        daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the
                        means of respectable subsistence hereafter.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01623" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Such was Jane Fairfax's
                        history. She had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the
                        Campbells, and been given an excellent education. Living constantly with
                        right-minded and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had
                        received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's
                        residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice
                        to, by the attendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities
                        were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or
                        nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care
                        of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she
                        was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could
                        promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It
                        was easy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with
                        them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an
                        elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only
                        the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own good
                        understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01624" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The affection of the whole
                        family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular, was the more
                        honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority
                        both in beauty and acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could
                        not be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be
                        unfelt by the parents. They continued together with unabated regard however,
                        till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so
                        often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what
                        is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of Mr.
                        Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were
                        acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet
                        her bread to earn.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01625" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">This event had very lately
                        taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less
                        fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty; though she had now
                        reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning. She had
                        long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period. With the fortitude
                        of a devoted novitiate, she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the
                        sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational
                        intercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for
                        ever.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01626" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The good sense of Colonel and
                        Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution, though their feelings
                        did.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01627" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_colcmrsc" data-placement="auto top">
                        As long
                        as they lived, no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for
                        ever; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but
                        this would be selfishness:—what must be at last, had better be
                        soon.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01628" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Perhaps they began to feel
                        it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any
                        delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as
                        must now be relinquished. Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any
                        reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01629" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_colcmrsc" data-placement="auto top">
                        She had
                        never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage; and till
                        she should have completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid
                        her engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened
                        frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,
                        to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be
                        discharged with tolerable comfort.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01630" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">With regard to her not
                        accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her aunt contained nothing but
                        truth, though there might be some truths not told. It was her own choice to
                        give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last
                        months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very
                        dear: and</span>

                        they
                        depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery of

                    <span id="said_no_01635" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Certain it was that she was
                        to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which
                        had been so long promised it— Mr. Frank Churchill —must put up
                        for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a
                        two years' absence.</span></p>

                        months!—to be always doing more than she wished, and less than she

                        it was
                        because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she wanted

                    <span id="said_no_01641" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and though the accusation
                        had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination
                        in which her conscience could not quite acquit her. But</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01642" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"she could never get

                        coldness and reserve— such apparent indifference whether she pleased
                        or not —and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!—and she
                        was made such a fuss with by every body!—and it had been always
                        imagined that they were to be so intimate—because their ages were the

                <p><span id="said_no_01644" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was a dislike so little
                        just — —every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy, that she never
                        saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence, without
                        feeling that she had injured her; and now, when the due visit was paid, on
                        her arrival, after a two years' interval,</span>

                        the very
                        appearance and manners, which for those two whole years she had been
                        depreciating. Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had
                        herself the highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as
                        almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her
                        figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between fat
                        and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the
                        likeliest evil of the two.</span>

                        and then, her
                        face— her features —there was more beauty in them altogether
                        than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing
                        beauty.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01649" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her eyes, a deep grey, with
                        dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the
                        skin, which she had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a
                        clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01650" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        It was a
                        style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such,
                        she must, in honour, by all her principles, admire it:—elegance,
                        which, whether of person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There,
                        not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit.</span></p>

                        she would
                        dislike her no longer. When she took in her history, indeed, her situation,
                        as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance was
                        destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it
                        seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially,
                        if to every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the
                        highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so
                        naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more pitiable
                        or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.</span>

                        acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any
                        thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first.</span>

                        If it were
                        love, it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone. She
                        might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of
                        his conversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,
                        might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide
                        herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career
                        of laborious duty.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01656" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Upon the whole, Emma left her
                        with such softened, charitable feelings, as made her look around in walking
                        home, and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her
                        independence; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01657" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">These were charming
                        feelings—but not lasting. Before she had committed herself by any
                        public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax, or done more
                        towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to Mr.

                    <span id="said_no_01659" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Jane had spent an evening at
                        Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much
                        into its usual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as
                        tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now
                        added to admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description
                        of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small
                        a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and
                        new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.
                        They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which
                        necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air of
                        greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior
                        performance.</span>

                        She was,
                        besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no
                        getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed
                        determined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously
                        reserved.</span></p>

                        where all was most, she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the
                        Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr.
                        Dixon's character, or her own value for his company, or opinion of the
                        suitableness of the match. It was all general approbation and smoothness;
                        nothing delineated or distinguished. It did her no service however. Her
                        caution was thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first
                        surmises.</span>

                        preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for
                        the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future
                        twelve thousand pounds.</span></p>

                        real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was.</span>
