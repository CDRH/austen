                <p><span id="said_no_00001" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma Woodhouse, handsome,
                        clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to
                        unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly
                        twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex
                        her.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00002" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was the youngest of the
                        two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in
                        consequence of her sister's marriage, been mistress of his house from a very
                        early period. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an
                        indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by
                        an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in
                        affection.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00003" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sixteen years had Miss Taylor
                        been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond
                        of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between <em>them</em> it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor
                        had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her
                        temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of
                        authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as
                        friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she
                        liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her
                        own.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00004" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The real evils, indeed, of
                        Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a
                        disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the
                        disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments. The danger,
                        however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank
                        as misfortunes with her.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00005" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sorrow came— — a gentle
                        sorrow— — but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable
                        consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's loss which
                        first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that
                        Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over, and
                        the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together,
                        with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. Her father composed
                        himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and
                        think of what she had lost.</span></p>

                        happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character,
                        easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some
                        satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she
                        had always wished and promoted the match;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00007" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">but it was a black morning's

                        she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old— —
                        how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in
                        health—and how nursed her through the various illnesses of
                        childhood.</span>

                        equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's
                        marriage, on their being left to each other,</span>

                        friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed,
                        useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its
                        concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every
                        scheme of hers— — one to whom she could speak every thought as it
                        arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find
                        fault.</span></p>

                        difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss

                    <span id="said_no_00019" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and with all her advantages,
                        natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from
                        intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion
                        for her. He could not meet her in conversation, rational or
                    playful.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00020" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The evil of the actual
                        disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much
                        increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian
                        all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in
                        ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of
                        his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him
                        at any time.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00021" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her sister, though
                        comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only
                        sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily reach; and many a long October
                        and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before
                        Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband, and their
                        little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society
                        again.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00022" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Highbury, the large and
                        populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite
                        of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded
                        her no equals. The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up
                        to them. She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was
                        universally civil, but</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00023" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">not one among them
                        who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00024" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was a melancholy change;
                        and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till
                        her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required
                        support. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he
                        was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.
                        Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by
                        no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak
                        of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of
                        affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from
                        his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that
                        other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed
                        to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and
                        would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her
                        life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to
                        keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him
                        not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00025" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Poor Miss Taylor!—I
                        wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of
                        her!"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00026" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"I cannot agree with you,
                        papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant,
                        excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;—and you would
                        not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours,
                        when she might have a house of her own?"</span></p>

                        it all over with Mr. Weston last night. And as for James, you may be very
                        sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being
                        housemaid there. I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.
                        That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of
                        Hannah till you mentioned her— — James is so obliged to

                        slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant:
                        she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever
                        I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty
                        manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she
                        always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am
                        sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to
                        poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see.
                        Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing
                        of us. He will be able to tell her how we all are."</span></p>

                        coming directly from their mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a

                        comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him single any
                        longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked
                        so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him!
                        I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him
                        a service."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00090" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Mr. Elton is a very pretty
                        young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard
                        for him. But if you want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come
                        and dine with us some day. That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr.
                        Knightley will be so kind as to meet him."</span></p>

                            entirely, that it will be a much better thing. Invite him to dinner,
                            Emma, and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave
                            him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or
                            seven-and-twenty can take care of himself."</span></p>
