                <p><span id="said_no_04809" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The weather continued much
                        the same all the following morning; and the same loneliness, and the same
                        melancholy, seemed to reign at Hartfield—but in the afternoon it
                        cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried
                        off; the sun appeared; it was summer again. With all the eagerness which
                        such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as
                        possible. Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature,
                        tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her.
                        She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr.
                        Perry's coming in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her
                        father, she lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.—There, with
                        spirits freshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few
                        turns, when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and
                        coming towards her.—It was the first intimation of his being returned
                        from London. She had been thinking of him the moment before, as
                        unquestionably sixteen miles distant.—There was time only for the
                        quickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half a
                        minute they were together. The "How d'ye do's" were quiet and constrained on
                        each side.</span>

                        another dread. Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to
                        Harriet; he might be watching for encouragement to begin.—She did not,
                        could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject. He must do it all
                        himself. Yet she could not bear this silence. With him it was most
                        unnatural. She considered— resolved —and, trying to smile,

                        them in a way that I must always be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly
                        tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant
                        conjectures, but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the

                            called for seriousness on my side. He has imposed on me, but he has not
                            injured me. I have never been attached to him. And now I can tolerably
                            comprehend his behaviour. He never wished to attach me. It was merely a
                            blind to conceal his real situation with another.—It was his
                            object to blind all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more
                            effectually blinded than myself—except that I was <em>not</em> blinded— that it was my good
                            fortune— that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from

                            prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has
                            before him!—Assured of the love of such a woman —the
                            disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her
                            disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,—equality of
                            situation—I mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits

                            there is no doubt of <em>her</em> regard, must, I think,
                            be the happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is, indeed, the
                            favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets
                            with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even
                            weary her by negligent treatment—and had he and all his family
                            sought round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have
                            found her superior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt
                            dies.—He has only to speak.—His friends are eager to promote
                            his happiness.—He had used every body ill—and they are all
                            delighted to forgive him.—He is a fortunate man

                        to see that
                        Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as
                        complete a delusion as any of her own— that Harriet was nothing; that
                        she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to
                        Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her
                        agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all
                        received as discouragement from herself.—</span>

                        heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to
                        transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most
                        worthy of the two—or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to
                        refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he
                        could not marry them both, Emma had it not.</span>

                        way was clear, though not quite smooth.—She spoke then, on being so

                        hope;—she had begun by refusing to hear him.—The change had
                        perhaps been somewhat sudden;—her proposal of taking another turn, her
                        renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to, might be a
                        little extraordinary!—</span>

                        this case, though the conduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not
                        be very material.—Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more
                        relenting heart than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of
                        his.</span></p>

                        He had
                        followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come, in
                        his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no
                        selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an
                        opening, to soothe or to counsel her.—The rest had been the work of
                        the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The
                        delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill, of
                        her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth to the
                        hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;—but it had
                        been no present hope— — he had only, in the momentary conquest of
                        eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his
                        attempt to attach her.—</span>

                        there had
                        been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,
                        of Frank Churchill.—He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of
                        Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably
                        enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that
                        had taken him from the country.—The Box Hill party had decided him on
                        going away. He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,
                        encouraged attentions.—He had gone to learn to be
                        indifferent.—But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much
                        domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in
                        it; Isabella was too much like Emma— differing only in those striking
                        inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him, for
                        much to have been done, even had his time been longer.—He had stayed
                        on, however, vigorously, day after day— till this very morning's post
                        had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.—Then, with the gladness
                        which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having never
                        believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much fond
                        solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no longer. He
                        had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner,
                        to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of
                        all her faults, bore the discovery.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04932" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">He had found her agitated and
                        low.—Frank Churchill was a villain.— He heard her declare that
                        she had never loved him. Frank Churchill's character was not
                        desperate.—She was his own Emma, by hand and word, when they returned
                        into the house; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then, he
                        might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow.</span></p>
