                <p><span id="said_no_01817" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Human nature is so well
                        disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young
                        person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken
                        of.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01818" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">A week had not passed since
                        Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in Highbury, before she was, by some
                        means or other, discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind;
                        to be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and
                        when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and
                        circulate the fame of her merits, there was very little more for him to do,
                        than to tell her Christian name, and say whose music she principally
                        played.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01819" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Elton returned, a very
                        happy man. He had gone away rejected and mortified— disappointed in a
                        very sanguine hope, after a series of what appeared to him strong
                        encouragement; and not only losing the right lady, but finding himself
                        debased to the level of a very wrong one. He had gone away deeply
                        offended— he came back engaged to another—and to another as
                        superior, of course, to the first, as under such circumstances what is
                        gained always is to what is lost. He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager
                        and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss
                    Smith.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01820" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The charming Augusta Hawkins,
                        in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit, was in
                        possession of an independent fortune, of so many thousands as would always
                        be called ten; a point of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the
                        story told well; he had not thrown himself away— he had gained a woman
                        of 10,000 l. or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful
                        rapidity— the first hour of introduction had been so very soon
                        followed by distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs.
                        Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious— the steps
                        so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and
                        the party at Mrs. Brown's— smiles and blushes rising in
                        importance— with consciousness and agitation richly scattered—
                        the lady had been so easily impressed —so sweetly disposed— had
                        in short, to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him,
                        that vanity and prudence were equally contented.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01821" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">He had caught both substance
                        and shadow —both fortune and affection, and was just the happy man he
                        ought to be; talking only of himself and his own concerns— expecting
                        to be congratulated —ready to be laughed at—and, with cordial,
                        fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of the place, to whom,
                        a few weeks ago, he would have been more cautiously gallant.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01822" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The wedding was no distant
                        event, as the parties had only themselves to please, and nothing but the
                        necessary preparations to wait for; and when he set out for Bath again,
                        there was a general expectation, which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did
                        not seem to contradict, that when he next entered Highbury he would bring
                        his bride.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01823" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">During his present short
                        stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just enough to feel that the first
                        meeting was over, and to give her the impression of his not being improved
                        by the mixture of pique and pretension, now spread over his air. She was, in
                        fact, beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing
                        at all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very
                        disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a
                        lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have
                        been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again. She wished him very
                        well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would
                        administer most satisfaction.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01824" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The pain of his continued
                        residence in Highbury, however, must certainly be lessened by his
                        marriage.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01825" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        Many vain
                        solicitudes would be prevented —many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A
                            <em>Mrs.</em>
                        <em>Elton</em> would be an excuse for any change of
                        intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark. It would be almost
                        beginning their life of civility again.</span></p>

                        She was good
                        enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury—
                        handsome enough—to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As to
                        connexion,</span>

                        after all his
                        own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On that
                        article, truth seemed attainable.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01832" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        <em>What</em> she was, must be uncertain; but <em>who</em> she was, might be found out; and setting aside
                        the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet's
                        superior.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01833" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        She brought
                        no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two
                        daughters of a Bristol— merchant, of course, he must be called; but,
                        as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very
                        moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had
                        been very moderate also. Part of every winter she had been used to spend in
                        Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the
                        father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained—in the
                        law line— nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than
                        that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived.</span>

                        connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was <em>very</em>
                        <em>well</em>
                        <em>married</em>, to a gentleman in a <em>great</em>

                        Could she but
                        have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had talked her into love;
                        but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out of it. The charm of an
                        object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's mind was not to be talked
                        away. He might be superseded by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing
                        could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but
                        nothing else, she feared, would cure her. Harriet was one of those, who,
                        having once begun, would be always in love.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01838" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        And now, poor
                        girl! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton. She
                        was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01839" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma saw him only once; but
                        two or three times every day Harriet was sure <em>just</em> to
                        meet with him, or <em>just</em> to miss him, <em>just</em> to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, <em>just</em> to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all
                        the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture. She was, moreover,
                        perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was
                        always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so
                        interesting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report, therefore,
                        every guess— all that had already occurred, all that might occur in
                        the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income, servants, and
                        furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her regard was receiving
                        strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and
                        feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness, and
                        continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!—his air as he
                        walked by the house— the very sitting of his hat, being all in proof
                        of how much he was in love!</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01840" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Had it been allowable
                        entertainment, had there been no pain to her friend, or reproach to herself,
                        in the waverings of Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its
                        variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and
                        each was occasionally useful as a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement
                        had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness
                        produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by
                        Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet
                        had not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her, written
                        in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal
                        of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied
                        by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return, and wishing
                        to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in person, had driven
                        away all such cares. While he staid, the Martins were forgotten; and on the
                        very morning of his setting off for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of
                        the distress it occasioned, judged it best for her to return Elizabeth
                        Martin's visit.</span></p>

                        acknowledged —what would be necessary—and what might be safest,
                        had been a point of some doubtful consideration.</span>

                        ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the
                        acquaintance—!</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01843" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">After much thinking, she
                        could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's returning the visit; but
                        in a way that, if they had understanding, should convince them that it was
                        to be only a formal acquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage,
                        leave her at the Abbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for
                        her again so soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or
                        dangerous recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what
                        degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.</span></p>
