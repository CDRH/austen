                    <span id="said_no_04522" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Those were the words; in
                        them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which
                        constituted the real misery of the business to her.</span>

                        Frank
                        Churchill had behaved very ill by herself— very ill in many
                        ways,—but it was not so much <em>his</em> behaviour as
                        her <em>own</em>, which made her so angry with him. It was the
                        scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave the
                        deepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe
                        of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically,
                        when he once said,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04524" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Emma, you have been no
                        friend to Harriet Smith."—</span>

                        She was
                        afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.—It was true that she
                        had not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the
                        sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such
                        feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for
                        Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill
                        before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely
                        guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have
                        prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence
                        would have been enough.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04526" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">And now she was very
                        conscious that she ought to have prevented them.—She felt that</span>

                        she had been
                        risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense
                        would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to
                        think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his
                        ever caring for her.—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04528" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"But, with common

                <p><span id="said_no_04531" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was extremely angry with
                        herself. If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too, it would
                        have been dreadful.—As for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve
                        her feelings from any present solicitude on her account.</span>

                        Harriet would
                        be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles
                        and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally
                        under cure.—</span>

                        Her days of
                        insignificance and evil were over.—She would soon be well, and happy,
                        and prosperous.—</span>

                        No doubt it
                        had been from jealousy.—In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well
                        might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed. An
                        airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack, and arrowroot
                        from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She understood it all; and

                        Jane Fairfax

                        Harriet was such an engrossing charge!</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04541" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was little sympathy to

                        this second
                        disappointment would be more severe than the first. Considering the very
                        superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently
                        stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it
                        would.—She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as
                        possible.</span>

                        should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard
                        and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained—or to
                        deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her

                        therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a
                        more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which
                        had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite
                        sunk and lost.—Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and

                        Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give the history of her hopes with
                        great, though trembling delight.—Emma's tremblings as she asked, and
                        as she listened, were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not
                        less. Her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation
                        that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a
                        confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.—She listened
                        with much inward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet's
                        detail.—Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could
                        not be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the
                        feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her
                        spirit— especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own
                        memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of

                        more than he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different
                        manner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!—Latterly she
                        had been more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together,
                        he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very

                        he saw such

                        look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied, a
                        preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma.
                        Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation, and contained
                        multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her
                        who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two
                        of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness

                        The first,
                        was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell,
                        where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken
                        pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself—and
                        at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever
                        done before, in a very particular way indeed!—</span>

                        He seemed to
                        be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.—But as soon
                        as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the
                        subject, and began talking about farming:—The second, was his having
                        sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her
                        visit, the very last morning of his being at Hartfield—though, when he
                        first came in, he had said that he could not stay five minutes— and
                        his having told her, during their conversation, that though he must go to
                        London, it was very much against his inclination that he left home at

                        Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit.</span></p>
