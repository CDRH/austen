                        that night. For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her
                        time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to
                        herself; and</span>

                        respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible just
                        at present.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00529" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was obliged to go the
                        next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be
                        settled that she should return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some
                        days.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00530" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">While she was gone, Mr.
                        Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr.
                        Woodhouse, who had previously made up his mind to walk out, was persuaded by
                        his daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the entreaties of both,
                        though against the scruples of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for
                        that purpose. Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was
                        offering by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the
                        protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00531" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Well, I believe, if you will
                        excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not consider me as doing a very rude
                        thing, I shall take Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour. As
                        the sun is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can. I
                        treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are
                        privileged people."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00533" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"I leave an excellent
                        substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to entertain you. And
                        therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns— — my
                        winter walk."</span></p>

                        of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a very slow walker, and my pace
                        would be tedious to you; and, besides, you have another long walk before
                        you, to Donwell Abbey."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00536" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Thank you, sir, thank you;
                        I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner <em>you</em> go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden
                        door for you."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00537" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Woodhouse at last was
                        off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being immediately off likewise, sat down
                        again, seemingly inclined for more chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and
                        speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard
                        before.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"I cannot rate her

                            little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her
                            disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good
                            hands she will turn out a valuable woman."</span></p>

                            compliment, so I will tell you that you have improved her. You have
                            cured her of her school-girl's giggle; she really does you
                            credit."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00545" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Thank you. I should be
                        mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use; but it is not
                        every body who will bestow praise where they may. <em>You</em>
                        do not often overpower me with it."</span></p>

                        for contradiction, and therefore said nothing. He presently added, with a

                        little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_00553" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Indeed! how so? of what

                <p><span id="said_no_00554" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"A very serious sort, I

                <p><span id="said_no_00557" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma was more than half in
                        hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint. Mr. Knightley was a sort of
                        general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr. Elton looked up to
                    him.</span></p>

                            summer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and
                            means to marry her."</span></p>

                        purpose to consult me about it. He knows I have a thorough regard for him
                        and all his family, and, I believe, considers me as one of his best

                    <span id="said_no_00567" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">in short,</span>

                        his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being
                        considered (especially since <em>your</em> making so much of
                        her) as in a line of society above him.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00569" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">I was very much pleased
                        with all that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert
                        Martin. He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very
                        well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what
                        they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is an excellent
                        young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to
                        marry. He proved to me that he could afford it; and that being the case, I
                        was convinced he could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and
                        altogether sent him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion
                        before, he would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the
                        house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened
                        the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow
                        much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear to
                        have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.
                        Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking him
                        at all a tiresome wretch."</span></p>

                            Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet
                            Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion
                            higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows
                            whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no
                            respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common
                            school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She
                            has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have
                            acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have no experience, and
                            with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail
                            her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all. My only
                            scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being beneath his
                            deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that, as to fortune, in all
                            probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational companion
                            or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I could not reason so to
                            a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her,
                            to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his,
                            might be easily led aright and turn out very well. The advantage of the
                            match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor
                            have I now) that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good
                            luck. Even <em>your</em> satisfaction I made sure of. It
                            crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's
                            leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember
                            saying to myself, 'Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will

                        claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them. She is
                        not a clever girl, but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does
                        not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that
                        point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty
                        and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,
                        they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in
                        fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of
                        an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the

                        love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such
                        loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of
                        having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be
                        nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as
                        it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble
                        opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people. I
                        am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty,

                            nobody within her reach will be good enough for her. Vanity working on a

                            with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may

                        habitual respect for his judgment in general, which made her dislike having

                        angry state, was very disagreeable. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant
                        silence, with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he
                        made no answer. He was thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last
                        in these words.</span></p>

                        does. Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself; but as you make no
                        secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and
                        plans, and projects you have;—and as a friend I shall just hint to you
                        that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain."</span></p>

                        Highbury, but not at all likely to make an imprudent match. He knows the
                        value of a good income as well as any body. Elton may talk sentimentally,
                        but he will act rationally. He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as
                        you can be with Harriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome young man,
                        and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking
                        in unreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that
                        he does not mean to throw himself away.</span>

                        off abruptly. He was very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the

                        sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in
                        the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.</span></p>

                        in his. She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so
                        entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong,
                        as Mr. Knightley. He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he
                        left for her. She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a
                        little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives.
                        Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.</span>

                        reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled

                        Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to
                        money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to
                        them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence
                        of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no
                        such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too
                        much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a
                        reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable,
                        becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr.
