                            convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best. It
                            would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older— — and
                            even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence — —to have
                            his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and
                            the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston—
                            — no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would
                            be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not
                            have their powers in exercise again.</span></p>

                            no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor gave you
                            principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite as likely
                            to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what right has
                            he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to feel
                            that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did you
                            any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the
                            tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without
                            doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,
                            have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at

                                is to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as
                                much for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with
                                her when she is thirteen."</span></p>

                            could not be more openly just to one important service which his better
                            sense would have rendered her, to the advice which would have saved her
                            from the worst of all her womanly follies— — her wilful intimacy
                            with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a subject.—She could not
                            enter on it.—Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them. This,
                            on his side, might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but
                            Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion,
                            from some appearances, that their friendship were declining. She was
                            aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they
                            certainly should have corresponded more, and that her intelligence would
                            not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on Isabella's letters. He
                            might observe that it was so. The pain of being obliged to practise
                            concealment towards him, was very little inferior to the pain of having
                            made Harriet unhappy.</span></p>

                    <p><span id="said_no_05271" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Isabella sent quite as
                            good an account of her visitor as could be expected; on her first
                            arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which appeared perfectly
                            natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that
                            business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet different
                            from what she had known her before.—Isabella, to be sure, was no
                            very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with
                            the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma's comforts and hopes
                            were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer; her
                            fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley
                            were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain till they
                            could bring her back.</span></p>

                            it, and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was

                            As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr.
                            Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings
                            should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it at home,
                            and then at Randalls.—But how to break it to her father at
                            last!—She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.
                            Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have
                            failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come
                            at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.—She
                            was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a
                            more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself. She
                            must not appear to think it a misfortune.—With all the spirits she
                            could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,
                            in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be
                            obtained— which, she trusted, would be attended with no
                            difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—
                            she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would
                            receive the constant addition of that person's company whom she knew he
                            loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the
                        world.</span></p>

                            first a considerable shock to him, and he tried earnestly to dissuade
                            her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of having always said she
                            would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal better for
                            her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss
                            Taylor.—But it would not do. Emma hung about him affectionately,
                            and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with
                            Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield,
                            had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not going from
                            Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing no change in
                            their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very
                            sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley
                            always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.—Did he not
                            love Mr. Knightley very much?—He would not deny that he did, she
                            was sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr.
                            Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his
                            letters, who so glad to assist him?—Who so cheerful, so attentive,
                            so attached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the
                            spot?—Yes. That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be
                            there too often; he should be glad to see him every day;—but they
                            did see him every day as it was.—Why could not they go on as they
                            had done?</span></p>

                            be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time
                            and continual repetition must do the rest.—To Emma's entreaties
                            and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond praise of her gave
                            the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to
                            by each, on every fair occasion.—They had all the assistance which
                            Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs.
                            Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the
                            most serviceable light— first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a
                            good one —well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two
                            recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.—It was agreed upon, as
                            what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring
                            him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself
                            which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or
                            other— in another year or two, perhaps— it might not be so
                            very bad if the marriage did take place.</span></p>

                            part, feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the
                            event.—She had been extremely surprized, never more so, than when
                            Emma first opened the affair to her; but she saw in it only increase of
                            happiness to all, and had no scruple in urging him to the
                            utmost.—She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as to think he
                            deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper,
                            suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point
                            of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible, so singularly
                            fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached
                            herself to any other creature, and that she had herself been the
                            stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it long
                            ago.—How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma
                            would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.
                            Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an
                            arrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.
                            Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a
                            marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe
                            and Hartfield had been a continual impediment — —less acknowledged
                            by Mr. Weston than by herself— — but even he had never been able
                            to finish the subject better than by saying—</span>

                            It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without
                            one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.</span></p>

                            was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of

                            quickness of mind.—He saw the advantages of the match, and
                            rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of

                            Vicarage.—There, the surprize was not softened by any
                            satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife;
                            he only hoped</span>

                                pride would now be contented;"</span>

                                to catch Knightley if she could;"</span>

                                living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim,</span>
                            <span id="said_no_05312" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"Rather he than

                        <span id="said_no_05313" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">But Mrs. Elton was very
                            much discomposed indeed.—</span>
                        <span id="said_no_05314" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"Poor Knightley! poor
                            fellow!—sad business for him."—</span>
                        <span id="said_no_05315" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was extremely
                            concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good
                            qualities.—How could he be so taken in?—Did not think him at
                            all in love— not in the least.—Poor Knightley!—There
                            would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.—How happy he
                            had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him! But that
                            would be all over now.—Poor fellow!—No more exploring
                            parties to Donwell made for <em>her</em>. Oh! no; there
                            would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every
                            thing.—Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that
                            she had abused the housekeeper the other day.—Shocking plan,
                            living together. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove
                            who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the
                            first quarter.</span></p>
