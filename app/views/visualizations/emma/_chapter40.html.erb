                <p><span id="said_no_03681" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">A very few days had passed
                        after this adventure, when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small
                        parcel in her hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus
                        began:</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03682" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Harriet Smith" data-placement="auto top">"Miss Woodhouse— if you
                        are at leisure— I have something that I should like to tell you—
                        a sort of confession to make—and then, you know, it will be
                        over."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03683" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma was a good deal
                        surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a seriousness in Harriet's
                        manner which prepared her, quite as much as her words, for something more
                        than ordinary.</span></p>

                            with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered creature in
                                <em>one</em>
                            <em>respect</em>, it is very fit that you should have the
                            satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is
                            necessary— I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have
                            done, and I dare say you understand me."</span></p>

                            I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.—I do not care
                            whether I meet him or not— except that of the two I had rather not
                            see him—and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid
                            him—but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her
                            nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and all
                            that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable —I shall
                            never forget her look the other night!—However, I assure you, Miss
                            Woodhouse, I wish her no evil.—No, let them be ever so happy
                            together, it will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you
                            that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy—what I
                            ought to have destroyed long ago— what I ought never to have kept
                            —I know that very well</span>

                            what this parcel holds?"</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03695" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">said she, with a conscious

                        <em>precious</em>
                        <em>treasures</em> on the top. Her curiosity was greatly
                        excited. Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.
                        Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,
                        which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,
                        excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of
                    court-plaister.</span></p>

                        thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about
                        court-plaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!—It was
                        but a very few days before I had my sore throat— just before Mr. and
                        Mrs. John Knightley came— I think the very evening.—Do not you
                        remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife, and your
                        recommending court-plaister?—But, as you had none about you, and knew
                        I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a
                        piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept
                        playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me. And so
                        then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it—so I
                        put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then as a great
                        treat."</span></p>

                        prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you. Is

                        to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the
                        gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me

                        look—and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one moment such a

                        more than I can promise. I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I
                        do not by any means engage for its being returned. Consider what you are
                        about. Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you
                        can: at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of
                        his liking you. Be observant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your

                        again on the subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward
                        I know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were very
                        wrong before; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior, no doubt,
                        and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but
                        yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been
                        matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not have
                        you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your
                        thoughts to <em>him</em>, is a mark of good taste which I
                        shall always know how to value."</span></p>
