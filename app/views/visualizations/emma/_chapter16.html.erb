                        been wishing for!—Such a development of every thing most
                        unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of

                        compared with
                        the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she would gladly have submitted to
                        feel yet more mistaken —more in error —more disgraced by
                        mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the effects of her blunders have
                        been confined to herself.</span></p>

                        Certainly she
                        had often, especially of late, thought his manners to herself unnecessarily
                        gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere error of judgment, of
                        knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others that he had not always lived
                        in the best society, that with all the gentleness of his address, true
                        elegance was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never, for
                        an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as

                        To Mr. John
                        Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject, for the first
                        start of its possibility. There was no denying that those brothers had
                        penetration.</span>

                        what Mr.
                        Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given,

                        how much
                        truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had
                        reached herself. It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving
                        himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and
                        believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and
                        little concerned about the feelings of others.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01428" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Contrary to the usual course
                        of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in
                        her opinion. His professions and his proposals did him no service. She
                        thought nothing of his attachment, and was insulted by his hopes.</span>

                        He wanted to
                        marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to
                        be in love; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any
                        disappointment that need be cared for. There had been no real affection
                        either in his language or manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in
                        abundance; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any
                        tone of voice, less allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to
                        pity him. He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss
                        Woodhouse of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not
                        quite so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss
                        Somebody else with twenty, or with ten.</span></p>

                        But—that
                        he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware of his views,
                        accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry him!—should
                        suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down upon her
                        friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below him, and be so
                        blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in
                        addressing her!—It was most provoking.</span></p>

                        Perhaps it
                        was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in
                        talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of such equality might
                        prevent his perception of it; but he must know that in fortune and
                        consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know that the Woodhouses
                        had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of
                        a very ancient family—and that the Eltons were nobody.</span>

                        The landed
                        property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of
                        notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of Highbury
                        belonged; but their fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them
                        scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself, in every other kind of
                        consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the
                        consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two
                        years ago, to make his way as he could, without any alliances but in trade,
                        or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his
                        civility.—</span>

                        But he had

                        and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners

                        man of ordinary observation and delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying
                        himself a very decided favourite. If <em>she</em> had so
                        misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder that <em>he</em>, with self-interest to blind him, should have
                        mistaken hers.</span></p>

                        so active a part in bringing any two people together. It was adventuring too
                        far, assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of

                            with hope, if I had not assured her of his attachment, for she is as
                            modest and humble as I used to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied
                            with persuading her not to accept young Martin. There I was quite right.
                            That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the
                            rest to time and chance. I was introducing her into good company, and

                        be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the three
                        principals, and especially for her father's being given a moment's

                        three being quite asunder at present.</span></p>

                        favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she could not go to church. Mr.
                        Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it, and she
                        was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most
                        unsuitable ideas. The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that
                        unsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most
                        unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every
                        evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most honourable
                        prisoner. No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for
                        her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses
                        for Mr. Elton's absenting himself.</span></p>

                        be really taking comfort in some society or other, it was very pleasant to
                        have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house,
                        too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather
                        could keep entirely from them,—</span></p>

                        of great importance to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly
                        cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed
                        him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and
                        obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of
                        cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such an
                        evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as made it
                        impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.</span></p>
