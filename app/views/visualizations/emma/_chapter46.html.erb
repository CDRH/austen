                        after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston,
                        who</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04380" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"could not stay five
                        minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her."—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04381" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">He met her at the

                <p><span id="said_no_04382" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"Can you come to Randalls at
                        any time this morning?—Do, if it be possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see
                        you. She must see you."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04383" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Is she unwell?"</span></p>

                            all— only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage,
                            and come to you, but she must see you <em>alone</em>, and
                            that you know—</span>

                            come?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04387" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Certainly. This moment, if
                        you please. It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way. But what
                        can be the matter?—Is she really not ill?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04388" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"Depend upon me—but ask

                        was impossible even for Emma. Something really important seemed announced by

                        and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now, she and
                        Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick

                        and Frank was off with the light this morning. He stopped at Highbury, at
                        the Bates's, I fancy, some time—and then came on hither; but was in
                        such a hurry to get back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary
                        than ever, that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an
                        hour.—He was very much agitated— very much, indeed —to a
                        degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had
                        ever seen him before.—In addition to all the rest, there had been the
                        shock of finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion
                        of— and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great
                        deal."</span></p>

                        the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy?—The
                        Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04501" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma could not speak the name

                            shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding. What has it
                            been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and
                            treachery?—To come among us with professions of openness and
                            simplicity; and such a league in secret to judge us all!—Here have
                            we been, the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying
                            ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people
                            in the midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and
                            sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for
                            both to hear.—They must take the consequence, if they have heard
                            each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!"</span></p>

                        only blunder was confined to my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of

                <p><span id="said_no_04512" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"True. But as I have always
                        had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax, I never could, under any
                        blunder, have spoken ill of her; and as to speaking ill of him, there I must
                        have been safe."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04513" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">At this moment Mr. Weston
                        appeared at a little distance from the window, evidently on the watch. His
                        wife gave him a look which invited him in; and, while he was coming round,
                        added,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04514" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"Now, dearest Emma, let me
                        intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease, and
                        incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of
                        it—and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour.
                        It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that,
                        why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for
                        Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such
                        steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit
                        for—and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this one
                        great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may be said in
                        her situation for even that error!"</span></p>

                            their's, nor the world's law.'"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04518" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She met Mr. Weston on his

                        been playing me, upon my word! This was a device, I suppose, to sport with
                        my curiosity, and exercise my talent of guessing. But you really frightened
                        me. I thought you had lost half your property, at least. And here, instead
                        of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one of
                        congratulation.—I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on
                        the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women
                        in England for your daughter."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04520" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">A glance or two between him
                        and his wife, convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed;
                        and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate. His air and voice
                        recovered their usual briskness: he shook her heartily and gratefully by the
                        hand, and entered on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only
                        wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His
                        companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth
                        objections; and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had
                        talked it all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was
                        become perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best
                        thing that Frank could possibly have done.</span></p>
