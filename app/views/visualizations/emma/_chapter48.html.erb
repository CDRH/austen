                        threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her happiness
                        depended on being <em>first</em> with Mr. Knightley, first in
                        interest and affection.—Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it her
                        due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being
                        supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.—</span>

                        Long, very
                        long, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions of his
                        own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers,
                        and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella. She
                        had herself been first with him for many years past. She had not deserved
                        it; she had often been negligent or perverse, slighting his advice, or even
                        wilfully opposing him, insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with
                        him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her
                        own—but still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough
                        excellence of mind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with
                        an endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no
                        other creature had at all shared.</span>

                        In spite of
                        all her faults, she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very
                        dear?—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04715" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">When the suggestions of
                        hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she could not
                        presume to indulge them.</span>

                        Harriet Smith
                        might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively,
                        passionately loved by Mr. Knightley. <em>She</em> could not.
                        She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment
                        to <em>her</em>. She had received a very recent proof of its
                        impartiality.—</span>

                        How shocked
                        had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had
                        he expressed himself to her on the subject!—Not too strongly for the
                        offence—but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer
                        than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.—</span>

                        She had no

                        affection for herself which was now in question;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04719" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">but there was a hope (at

                        Harriet might
                        have deceived herself, and be overrating his regard for <em>her</em>.—</span>

                        must, for his sake —be the consequence nothing to herself, but his
                        remaining single all his life. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his
                        never marrying at all, she believed she should be perfectly
                        satisfied.—Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her
                        father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield
                        lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and
                        her peace would be fully secured.—Marriage, in fact, would not do for
                        her. It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with
                        what she felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She
                        would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.</span></p>

                        when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's thoughts a little from the one subject
                        which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four
                        hours— Mrs. Weston, who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect,
                        and took Hartfield in her way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in
                        pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an
                        interview.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04741" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Weston had accompanied
                        her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his share of this essential attention
                        most handsomely; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an
                        airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with
                        satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with
                        all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.</span></p>

                        Mrs. Weston
                        had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the
                        first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to
                        write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a
                        little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the
                        engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing, she thought such a
                        visit could not be paid without leading to reports:—but Mr. Weston had
                        thought differently; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to
                        Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could
                        be excited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence;

                         Mr. Weston
                        had very good reason for saying so.</span>

                        They had
                        gone, in short —and very great had been the evident distress and
                        confusion of the lady. She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every
                        look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.
                        The quiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous
                        delight of her daughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,
                        had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so
                        truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;
                        thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of themselves,
                        that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss Fairfax's recent
                        illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing;
                        she had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded;
                        and, in the course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,
                        overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the
                        important subject. Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their
                        first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always
                        feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but
                        when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present
                        and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was convinced that
                        such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up
                        within her own mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much
                        pleased with all that she had said on the subject.</span></p>
