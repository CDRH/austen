                <h3>Chapter I</h3>

                <p><span id="said_no_03444" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">A very little quiet
                        reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on
                        hearing this news of Frank Churchill.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03445" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was soon convinced
                        that</span>

                        it was not
                        for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for
                        him. Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not
                        worth thinking of;—but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much
                        the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of
                        sentiment which he had taken away, it would be very distressing. If a
                        separation of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and
                        evils before her:—caution for him and for herself would be necessary.
                        She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be
                        incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03447" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She wished</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03448" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_9" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        she might be
                        able to keep him from an absolute declaration. That would be so very painful
                        a conclusion of their present acquaintance!</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03449" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and yet, she could not help
                        rather anticipating something decisive. She felt as if the spring would not
                        pass without bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter her present
                        composed and tranquil state.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03450" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was not very long, though
                        rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen, before she had the power of
                        forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's feelings. The Enscombe family were
                        not in town quite so soon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very
                        soon afterwards. He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do
                        more; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then
                        exercise all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was
                        influenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmost friendliness.
                        There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an
                        almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling
                        the same tenderness in the same degree. She watched him well.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03451" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        It was a
                        clear thing he was less in love than he had been. Absence, with the
                        conviction probably of her indifference, had produced this very natural and
                        very desirable effect.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03452" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">He was in high spirits; as
                        ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed delighted to speak of his former
                        visit, and recur to old stories: and he was not without agitation. It was
                        not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference. He was not
                        calm; his spirits were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about
                        him. Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself;
                        but what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter
                        of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03453" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Frank Churchill" data-placement="auto top">"He had seen a group of old
                        acquaintance in the street as he passed —he had not stopped, he would
                        not stop for more than a word—but he had the vanity to think they
                        would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay
                        longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off."</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03454" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        She had no
                        doubt as to his being less in love—but neither his agitated spirits,
                        nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather
                        inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a discreet
                        resolution of not trusting himself with her long.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03455" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was the only visit from
                        Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03456" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_frank" data-placement="auto top">
                        He was often
                        hoping, intending to come —but was always prevented. His aunt could
                        not bear to have him leave her.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03457" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Such was his own account at
                        Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was to
                        be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no service
                        to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was really ill was
                        very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, at Randalls.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03458" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_frank" data-placement="auto top">
                        Though much
                        might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a
                        weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago. He did not believe
                        it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove, or at
                        least that she might not have many years of existence before her;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03459" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">but he could not be
                        prevailed on, by all his father's doubts, to say that her complaints were
                        merely imaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03460" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">It soon appeared that</span>

                        London
                        was not the place for her. She could not endure its noise. Her nerves were
                        under continual irritation and suffering;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03462" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and by the ten days'

                        They
                        were going to remove immediately to Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been
                        recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had
                        otherwise a fancy for the place. A ready-furnished house in a favourite spot
                        was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03466" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma heard that</span>

                        Frank
                        wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement, and seemed most fully to
                        appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near
                        neighbourhood to many dear friends— for the house was taken for May
                        and June.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03468" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was told that</span>

                        now he
                        wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often
                        as he could even wish.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03470" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma saw how Mr. Weston
                        understood these joyous prospects. He was considering her as the source of
                        all the happiness they offered. She hoped it was not so. Two months must
                        bring it to the proof.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03471" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Weston's own happiness
                        was indisputable. He was quite delighted.</span>

                        It was the
                        very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be really having
                        Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a young man?—An
                        hour's ride. He would be always coming over. The difference in that respect
                        of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him
                        always and seeing him never. Sixteen miles— — nay, eighteen —
                        —it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street —was a serious
                        obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent in coming
                        and returning. There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as
                        well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy
                        intercourse. Better than nearer!</span></p>

                        immediately brought to a certainty by this removal —the ball at the
                        Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but it had been soon acknowledged
                        vain to attempt to fix a day. Now, however, it was absolutely to be; every
                        preparation was resumed, and very soon after the Churchills had removed to
                        Richmond,</span>
