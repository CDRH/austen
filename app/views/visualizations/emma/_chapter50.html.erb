                        feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought
                        out!—she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of
                        suffering;—she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness, and such
                        happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter
                        should have passed away.</span></p>

                        how often it
                        had been collected!—and how often had her eyes fallen on the same
                        shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the western
                        sun!</span>

                        state of spirits, never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty
                        that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of
                        the house, or even the attentive daughter.</span></p>

                        distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest perception
                        of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he repeated to
                        them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr.
                        Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of
                        what they could have told him in return.</span></p>

                        remained with them, Emma's fever continued; but when he was gone, she began
                        to be a little tranquillised and subdued—and in the course of the
                        sleepless night, which was the tax for such an evening, she found one or two
                        such very serious points to consider, as made her feel, that even her
                        happiness must have some alloy.</span>

                        Her
                        father—and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling the full
                        weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort of both to the
                        utmost, was the question.</span>

                        if divested
                        of the danger of drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to

                        How to do her
                        best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;—how to spare her from
                        any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement; how to appear
                        least her enemy?—</span>

                        surrounded it.—</span>

                        Isabella had

                        streets, the shops, and the children.—At any rate, it would be a proof
                        of attention and kindness in herself, from whom every thing was due; a
                        separation for the present; an averting of the evil day, when they must all
                        be together again.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04965" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She rose early, and wrote her
                        letter to Harriet; an employment which left her so very serious, so nearly
                        sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not
                        arrive at all too soon; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the
                        same ground again with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary
                        to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening
                        before.</span></p>

                        of any body else, when a letter was brought her from Randalls— a very
                        thick letter;—she guessed what it must contain, and deprecated the
                        necessity of reading it.—She was now in perfect charity with Frank
                        Churchill;</span>

                        she wanted no
                        explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself—and as
                        for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of
                        it.—It must be waded through, however.</span>

                                its happy effect.—I think we shall never materially disagree
                                about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long

                                lately.—I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday, but it was
                                an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being affected by
                                weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.—I felt
                                for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and

                                intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected; but expected
                                or not, I know it will be read with candour and
                                indulgence.—You are all goodness, and I believe there will be
                                need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past
                                conduct.—But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to
                                resent. My courage rises while I write. It is very difficult for the
                                prosperous to be humble. I have already met with such success in two
                                applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself
                                too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have had any
                                ground of offence.—You must all endeavour to comprehend the
                                exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls; you
                                must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all
                                hazards. This was the fact. My right to place myself in a situation
                                requiring such concealment, is another question. I shall not discuss
                                it here. For my temptation to <em>think</em> it a
                                right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows
                                below, and casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her
                                openly; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too
                                well known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to
                                prevail, before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most
                                upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret
                                engagement.—Had she refused, I should have gone mad.—But
                                you will be ready to say, what was your hope in doing
                                this?—What did you look forward to?—To any thing, every
                                thing— to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden
                                bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every
                                possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings
                                secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence. If
                                you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of
                                being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting a
                                disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses or
                                lands can ever equal the value of.—See me, then, under these
                                circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;—and
                                here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner
                                paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss
                                Fairfax was in Highbury; and as <em>you</em> were the
                                person slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on
                                my father's compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented
                                myself from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you.
                                My behaviour, during the very happy fortnight which I spent with
                                you, did not, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one
                                point. And now I come to the principal, the only important part of
                                my conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or
                                requires very solicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and
                                the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father
                                perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest
                                humiliation.—A few words which dropped from him yesterday
                                spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable
                                to.—My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more
                                than it ought.—In order to assist a concealment so essential
                                to me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort
                                of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.—I cannot
                                deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object—but I am
                                sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been convinced
                                of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any selfish
                                views to go on.—Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,
                                she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached;
                                and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached
                                to me, was as much my conviction as my wish.—She received my
                                attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which
                                exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each other. From our
                                relative situation, those attentions were her due, and were felt to
                                be so.—Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me
                                before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;—when I
                                called to take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment
                                of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without
                                suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at
                                least in some degree.—She may not have surmised the whole, but
                                her quickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You
                                will find, whenever the subject becomes freed from its present
                                restraints, that it did not take her wholly by surprize. She
                                frequently gave me hints of it. I remember</span>

                            <span id="said_no_04975" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Frank Churchill" data-placement="auto top">I hope this history
                                of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as
                                great extenuation of what you saw amiss. While you considered me as
                                having sinned against Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from
                                either. Acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable,
                                the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I
                                regard with so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her as
                                deeply and as happily in love as myself.—Whatever strange
                                things I said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to.
                                My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither
                                as often as might be, and with the least suspicion. If you remember
                                any queernesses, set them all to the right account.—Of the
                                pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that
                                its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F—, who would
                                never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given
                                her.—The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,
                                my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will
                                soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.—No
                                description can describe her. She must tell you herself what she
                                is— — yet not by word, for never was there a human creature
                                who would so designedly suppress her own merit.—Since I began
                                this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from
                                her.—She gives a good account of her own health; but as she
                                never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of
                                her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread
                                of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you
                                without delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember
                                how few minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a
                                state: and I am not much better yet; still insane either from
                                happiness or misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have
                                met with, of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity,
                                I am mad with joy: but when I recollect all the uneasiness I
                                occasioned her, and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad
                                with anger. If I could but see her again!—But I must not
                                propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to
                                encroach.—I must still add to this long letter. You have not
                                heard all that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected
                                detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the
                                unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation;
                                for though the event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude,
                                immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not have
                                presumed on such early measures, but from the very particular
                                circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose. I should myself
                                have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have felt every
                                scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.—But I
                                had no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered into with that
                                woman— Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off
                                abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.—I have been walking
                                over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the
                                rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is, in fact, a most
                                mortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can
                                admit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F.,
                                were highly blameable. <em>She</em> disapproved them,
                                which ought to have been enough.—My plea of concealing the
                                truth she did not think sufficient.—She was displeased; I
                                thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand occasions,
                                unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold. But
                                she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and subdued my
                                spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have
                                escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.—We
                                quarrelled.— Do you remember the morning spent at
                                    Donwell?—<em>There</em> every little
                                dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was
                                late; I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with
                                her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow
                                me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see
                                nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of
                                discretion. While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was
                                behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman,
                                was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have
                                made every previous caution useless?—Had we been met walking
                                together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been
                                suspected.—I was mad enough, however, to resent.—I
                                doubted her affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill;
                                when, provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent
                                neglect of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would
                                have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her
                                resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.—In
                                short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,
                                abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,
                                though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely
                                because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I was
                                not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was
                                the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away
                                determined that she should make the first advances.—I shall
                                always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.
                                Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would
                                ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon her appears in
                                the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she found I was
                                really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that
                                officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by
                                the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not
                                quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly
                                extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest
                                against the share of it which that woman has known.—</span>

                                will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by

                                hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of
                                needless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.
                                Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.—She closed with
                                this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next

                                a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any
                                uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from
                                her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was too busy,
                                and— may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be
                                captious.—We removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I
                                received a parcel from her, my own letters all returned!—and a

                                direction to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face.
                                I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw
                                what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that
                                resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy
                                she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter, was
                                equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would not
                                she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine
                                how, till I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the
                                blunders of the post.—What was to be done?—One thing
                                only.—I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction I could
                                not hope to be listened to again.—I spoke; circumstances were
                                in my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he
                                was, earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and

                                reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her. Do not pity me

                                certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not
                                disappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the
                                object of my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just
                                displeasure I had to persuade away. But it is done; we are
                                reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment's
                                uneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my dear madam, I
                                will release you; but I could not conclude before. A thousand and a
                                thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten
                                thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards
                                her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve, I
