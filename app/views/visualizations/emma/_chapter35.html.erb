                        judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight
                        herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking
                        together or silent together. Mrs. Elton left them no choice. If Jane
                        repressed her for a little time, she soon began again; and though much that
                        passed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side,
                        there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:</span>

                        always are for the <em>first</em> situations. I saw a vast
                        deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of Mr.
                        Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every body was
                        anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first circle. Wax-candles
                        in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all houses in the
                        kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you

                            trouble of making any inquiries at present."</span></p>

                        Jane, the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am. I
                        shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict
                        charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible."</span></p>

                        rather you did not mention the subject to her; till the time draws nearer, I
                        do not wish to be giving any body trouble."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03304" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"But, my dear child, the time
                        is drawing near; here is April, and June, or say even July, is very near,
                        with such business to accomplish before us. Your inexperience really amuses
                        me! A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you,
                        is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed,
                        indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03305" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Fairfax" data-placement="auto top">"Excuse me, ma'am, but this
                        is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry
                        to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I
                        am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town,
                        offices, where inquiry would soon produce something— Offices for the
                        sale— not quite of human flesh— but of human
                    intellect."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03306" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"Oh! my dear, human flesh!
                        You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr.
                        Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition."</span></p>

                            assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly as to
                            the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the
                            victims, I do not know where it lies. But I only mean to say that there
                            are advertising offices, and that by applying to them I should have no
                            doubt of very soon meeting with something that would

                            situation, in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to
                            command the elegancies of life."</span></p>

                        as to all that, I am very indifferent; it would be no object to me to be
                        with the rich; my mortifications, I think, would only be the greater; I
                        should suffer more from comparison. A gentleman's family is all that I
                        should condition for."</span></p>

                        talents, you have a right to move in the first circle. Your musical
                        knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms
                        as you like, and mix in the family as much as you chose;—that is
                        —I do not know— if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I

                        same half-whisper to Jane,</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03322" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"Here comes this dear old
                        beau of mine, I protest!—Only think of his gallantry in coming away
                        before the other men!—what a dear creature he is;—I assure you I
                        like him excessively. I admire all that quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it
                        is much more to my taste than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me.
                        But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant speeches
                        to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be
                        absolutely jealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my
                        gown. How do you like it?—Selina's choice —handsome, I think,
                        but I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest
                        dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed— quite a horror of finery. I
                        must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you
                        know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity;
                        a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am
                        quite in the minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of
                        dress,—show and finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting
                        such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will
                        look well?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03341" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"Well, he is coming, you see;
                        good news, I think. Well, what do you say to it?—I always told you he
                        would be here again soon, did not I?—Anne, my dear, did not I always
                        tell you so, and you would not believe me?—In town next week, you
                        see— at the latest, I dare say; for <em>she</em> is as
                        impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most likely
                        they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all nothing of
                        course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again, so near
                        as town. They will stay a good while when they do come, and he will be half
                        his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted. Well, pretty good news,
                        is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read it all? Put it up, put it up;
                        we will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not do now. I
                        shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common

                <p><span id="said_no_03342" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Weston was most
                        comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks and words had nothing to
                        restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to
                        be happy. Her congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak
                        so fluently. <em>She</em> was a little occupied in weighing
                        her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her agitation,
                        which she rather thought was considerable.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03343" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Weston, however, too
                        eager to be very observant, too communicative to want others to talk, was
                        very well satisfied with what she did say, and soon moved away to make the
                        rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room
                        must have overheard already.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03344" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was well that he took
                        every body's joy for granted, or he might not have thought either Mr.
                        Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly delighted. They were the first
                        entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;—from them he
                        would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation
                        with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive an interruption;
                        and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and her attention disengaged, he
                        necessarily began on the subject with her.</span></p>
