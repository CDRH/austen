                        her;—but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr.
                        Knightley, who had been of the party, and had seen only proper attention and
                        pleasing behaviour on each side, he was expressing the next morning, being
                        at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the
                        whole; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the
                        room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been
                        used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an
                        improvement.</span></p>

                            Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary, told that he
                            understood, and the papers swept away;—</span>
                        <span id="said_no_01674" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"particularly
                            pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music. I do not
                            know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be
                            entertained a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with
                            music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have
                            found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad
                            you made her play so much, for having no instrument at her
                            grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."</span></p>

                <p>An arch look expressed—"I understand you well enough;" but she said only,

                            little, and it did not disturb me. Miss Bates was very chatty and
                            good-humoured, as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick.
                            However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way.
                            I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young
                            lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. She must
                            have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had
                            Emma."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01698" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"She is a sort of elegant
                        creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from. I am always watching her to
                        admire; and I do pity her from my heart."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01699" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Knightley looked as if he
                        were more gratified than he cared to express; and before he could make any
                        reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose thoughts were on the Bates's,
                    said—</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01700" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"It is a great pity that
                        their circumstances should be so confined! a great pity indeed! and I have
                        often wished —but it is so little one can venture to do —small,
                        trifling presents, of any thing uncommon —Now we have killed a porker,
                        and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg; it is very small and
                        delicate— Hartfield pork is not like any other pork—but still it
                        is pork—and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure of their making it
                        into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without the smallest grease,
                        and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast pork— I think we had
                        better send the leg— do not you think so, my dear?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01701" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"My dear papa, I sent the
                        whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it. There will be the leg to be
                        salted, you know, which is so very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly
                        in any manner they like."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01702" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"That's right, my dear, very
                        right. I had not thought of it before, but that is the best way. They must
                        not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very
                        thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of,
                        with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it
                        unwholesome."</span></p>

                        and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest. Mr. Knightley
                        soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another syllable of
                        communication could rest with him.</span></p>

                        long; but she was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it—and all that

                            step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay half
                            a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she did
                            not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could, and

                            sure it was so very odd!—but they always dealt at Ford's
                            —who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her
                            brother!—Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have
                            fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the door—
                            Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the
                            umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took
                            no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and
                            I kept sitting near the door!—Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am
                            sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away you know,
                            because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but
                            there.—Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse— well, at last, I fancy, he
                            looked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they
                            began whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and
                            I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to
                            me—(do you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she
                            came forward— came quite up to me, and</span>

                            shake hands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that
                            she used; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to <em>try</em> to be very friendly, and we shook hands, and
                            stood talking some time; but I know no more what I said—I was in

                            should stop me from getting away—and then— only

                            know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and
                            spoke, and I answered—and I stood for a minute, feeling
                            dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and
                            said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got

                            hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I
                            would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,
                            there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and
