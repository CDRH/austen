                <p><span id="said_no_03866" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">After being long fed with
                        hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were
                        obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly
                        come till the autumn. No such importation of novelties could enrich their
                        intellectual stores at present. In the daily interchange of news, they must
                        be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the
                        Sucklings' coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs.
                        Churchill, whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and
                        the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might
                        eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all
                        her neighbours was by the approach of it.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03867" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Elton was very much
                        disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and
                        parade.</span>

                        Her
                        introductions and recommendations must all wait, and every projected party
                        be still only talked of.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03869" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">So she thought</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03870" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">at first;—but</span>

                        convinced her that</span>

                        every thing
                        need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the
                        Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the
                        autumn.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03873" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was settled that they
                        should go to Box Hill. That there was to be such a party had been long
                        generally known: it had even given the idea of another. Emma had never been
                        to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing,
                        and she and Mr. Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive
                        thither.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03874" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        Two or three
                        more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be
                        done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the
                        bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade
                        of the Eltons and the Sucklings.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03875" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was so very well
                        understood between them, that Emma could not but feel some surprise, and a
                        little displeasure, on hearing from</span>

                        he had been
                        proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had failed her, that the
                        two parties should unite, and go together;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03878" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and that</span>

                        as Mrs. Elton
                        had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she had no
                        objection.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03880" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Now, as her objection was
                        nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must
                        already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward
                        again:—it could not be done without a reproof to him, which would be
                        giving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent
                        to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03881" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        an
                        arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being
                        said to be of Mrs. Elton's party!</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03882" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Every feeling was offended;
                        and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of
                        secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr.
                        Weston's temper.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03883" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"I am glad you approve
                            of what I have done,"</span>
                        <span id="said_no_03884" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">said he very
                            comfortably.</span>
                        <span id="said_no_03885" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"But I thought you
                            would. Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers. One cannot
                            have too large a party. A large party secures its own amusement. And she
                            is a good-natured woman after all. One could not leave her
                        out."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03886" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma denied none of it aloud,
                        and agreed to none of it in private.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03887" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was now the middle of
                        June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the
                        day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame
                        carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it
                        might be only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations
                        could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's
                        resources were inadequate to such an attack.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03888" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"Is not this most
                            vexatious, Knightley?"</span>
                        <span id="said_no_03889" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">she cried.—</span>
                        <span id="said_no_03890" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"And such weather for
                            exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What
                            are we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing
                            done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful
                            exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03891" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"You had better
                            explore to Donwell,"</span>

                        <span id="said_no_03893" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"That may be done
                            without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening

                <p><span id="said_no_03894" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">If Mr. Knightley did not
                        begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so, for his proposal was caught
                        at with delight; and the</span>
                    <span id="said_no_03895" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"Oh! I should like it of all

                        than manner. Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea
                        for the invitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been
                        enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She
                        promised him again and again to come— much oftener than he
                        doubted— and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such
                        a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_03897" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"You may depend upon

                        bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm. Here,—probably this

                        you know. Every thing as natural and simple as possible. Is not that your
                        idea?"</span></p>

                        and furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors. When you are

                        they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the

                        the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with
                        pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit

                        some time over the gardens in a scattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three
                        together, they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a
                        broad short avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal
                        distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.—It
                        led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with
                        high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the
                        appearance of an approach to the house, which never had been there.
                        Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in
                        itself a charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely
                        pretty.—The considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey
                        stood, gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a
                        mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well
                        clothed with wood;—and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed
                        and sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the
                        river making a close and handsome curve around it.</span></p>

                        would have scorned her as a companion, and turned from her with little
                        ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant conversation.</span>

                        with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures,
                        spreading flocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke
                        ascending.—She joined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in
                        talking than in looking around. He was giving Harriet information as to
                        modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to
                        say,</span>
