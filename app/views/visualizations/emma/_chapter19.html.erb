                <h3>Chapter I</h3>

                <p><span id="said_no_01541" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma and Harriet had been
                        walking together one morning, and, in Emma's opinion, had been talking
                        enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could not think that Harriet's solace
                        or her own sins required more; and she was therefore industriously getting
                        rid of the subject as they returned;—but it burst out again when she
                        thought she had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor
                        must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very
                        plaintive—</span>

                        must be done.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01544" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">They were just approaching
                        the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates. She determined to call upon them
                        and seek safety in numbers. There was always sufficient reason for such an
                        attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was
                        considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as
                        rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to
                        the stock of their scanty comforts.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01545" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She had had many a hint from
                        Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart, as to her deficiency—but
                        none were equal to counteract the persuasion of</span>

                        its being
                        very disagreeable,—a waste of time— tiresome women —and
                        all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and
                        third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01547" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and therefore she seldom
                        went near them. But</span>

                        not passing
                        their door without going in—</span>

                        as she
                        proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just
                        now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01552" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The house belonged to people
                        in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied the drawing-room floor; and there,
                        in the very moderate-sized apartment, which was every thing to them, the
                        visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat
                        old lady, who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting
                        even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking
                        daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for
                        their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr.
                        Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's, and
                        sweet-cake from the beaufet—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01553" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"Mrs. Cole had just been
                        there, just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an
                        hour with them, and <em>she</em> had taken a piece of cake and
                        been so kind as</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01554" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">to say</span>

                        she liked it
                        very much;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01556" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">and, therefore, she hoped
                        Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece
                        too."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01557" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The mention of the Coles was
                        sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton. There was intimacy between them,
                        and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton since his going away.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01558" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma knew what was

                        they must
                        have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how
                        much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he
                        went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01560" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she went through it very
                        well, with all the interest and all the commendation that could be
                        requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged to
                        say a word.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01561" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">This she had been prepared
                        for when she entered the house; but meant, having once talked him handsomely
                        over, to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at
                        large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their
                        card-parties. She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr.
                        Elton; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from
                        him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her
                        niece.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01562" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"Oh! yes —Mr. Elton, I
                        understand —certainly as to dancing —Mrs. Cole was telling me
                        that dancing at the rooms at Bath was— Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit
                        some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as she came in, she began
                        inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a favourite there. Whenever she
                        is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough; and I
                        must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can. And so she began
                        inquiring after her directly, saying,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01563" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Cole" data-placement="auto top">'I know you cannot have
                        heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;'</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01564" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">and when I immediately said,
                        'But indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that
                        I ever saw any body more surprized.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01565" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Cole" data-placement="auto top">'Have you, upon your

                    <span id="said_no_01566" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">said she;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01567" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Cole" data-placement="auto top">'well, that is quite
                        unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01568" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma's politeness was at hand
                        directly, to say, with smiling interest—</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01569" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Have you heard from Miss

                            deceived aunt, while eagerly hunting for the letter.—</span>
                        <span id="said_no_01572" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"Oh! here it is. I was
                            sure it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,
                            without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so
                            very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was
                            reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again
                            to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her —a letter from Jane
                            —that she can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not
                            be far off, and here it is, only just under my huswife—and since
                            you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;—but, first of
                            all, I really must, in justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so
                            short a letter—only two pages you see —hardly two —and
                            in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half. My mother often
                            wonders that I can make it out so well. She often says, when the letter
                            is first opened,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_01573" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Cole" data-placement="auto top">'Well, Hetty, now I
                            think you will be put to it to make out all that
                            checker-work'—</span>
                        <span id="said_no_01574" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">don't you,
                            ma'am?—And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make
                            it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her— every word of
                            it —I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every
                            word. And, indeed though my mother's eyes are not so good as they were,
                            she can see amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of
                            spectacles. It is such a blessing! My mother's are really very good
                            indeed. Jane often says, when she is here,</span>
                        <span id="said_no_01575" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Fairfax" data-placement="auto top">'I am sure, grandmama,
                            you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do—and so much
                            fine work as you have done too!—I only wish my eyes may last me as
                            well.'"</span></p>

                        fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath; and Emma said something very

                <p><span id="said_no_01577" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"You are extremely

                            praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's. My
                            mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma'am,"</span>

                            Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane's

                <p><span id="said_no_01582" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">And Emma had the advantage of
                        hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old
                        lady could comprehend it. She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the
                        possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her escape from Jane
                        Fairfax's letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under
                        some slight excuse, when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her
                        attention.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01583" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"My mother's deafness is very
                        trifling you see —just nothing at all. By only raising my voice, and
                        saying any thing two or three times over, she is sure to hear; but then she
                        is used to my voice. But it is very remarkable that she should always hear
                        Jane better than she does me. Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not
                        find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying
                        a great deal at my mother's time of life— and it really is full two
                        years, you know, since she was here. We never were so long without seeing
                        her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make
                        enough of her now."</span></p>

                        Yes, next week. Every body is so surprized; and every body says the same

                        about. That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in
                        the common course, we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or
                        Wednesday."</span></p>

                    <span id="said_no_01596" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">positively, as I am going to
                        have the pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the
                        Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and
                        mother to come over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over
                        till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again—for till
                        she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week,
                        which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to
                        say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter
                        to her mother—or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but
                        we shall see presently in Jane's letter— wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as
                        well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give
                        them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat,
                        Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great deal of its
                        beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean —I do not know that she ever heard
                        about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he
                        should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his
                        addresses—and as Jane used to be very often walking out with
                        them— for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their
                        daughter's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at
                        all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss
                        Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that
                        he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken
                        himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite
                        longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01597" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">At this moment, an ingenious

                        this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the
                        insidious design of farther discovery,</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01598" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"You must feel it very
                        fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time.
                        Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you
                        could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and
                        Mrs. Campbell."</span></p>

                        The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of; for we should not
                        have liked to have her at such a distance from us, for months together
                        —not able to come if any thing was to happen. But you see, every thing
                        turns out for the best. They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to
                        come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it;</span>

                        Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a most
                        charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth,
                        when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden
                        whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed
                        into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not, with the
                        greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit— (I can never
                        think of it without trembling!)—But ever since we had the history of
                        that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01603" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"But, in spite of all her

                        Colonel and
                        Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should recommend;
                        and indeed they particularly <em>wish</em> her to try her
                        native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01606" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"I am concerned to hear of

                        disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal
                        beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01607" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"Oh! no. You are very obliging
                        to say such things— but certainly not. There is no comparison between
                        them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain—but extremely elegant
                        and amiable."</span></p>

                        and has never been well since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang
                        upon her? She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us.
                        Just like her! so considerate!—</span>

                        But however,
                        she is so far from well, that her kind friends the Campbells think she had
                        better come home, and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have
                        no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure
                        her—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01611" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">and it is certainly a great
                        deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is unwell.
                        Nobody could nurse her, as we should do."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01612" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"It appears to me the most

                <p><span id="said_no_01613" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"And so she is to come to us
                        next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to
                        Holyhead the Monday following—as you will find from Jane's letter. So
                        sudden!—You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has
                        thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of her illness —but I am
                        afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must
                        tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make a
                        point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first, before I read them
                        aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to
                        distress her. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began
                        to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her
                        being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane
                        is ill!'—which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and
                        was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so
                        bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that
                        she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off
                        my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The
                        expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of
                        Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance,
                        we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and family to
                        maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I have just given
                        you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am
                        sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for
                        her."</span></p>

                            but I have been so pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you

                        fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able
                        to escape the letter itself.</span></p>
