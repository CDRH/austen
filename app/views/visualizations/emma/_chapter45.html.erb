                <p><span id="said_no_04283" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma's pensive meditations,
                        as she walked home, were not interrupted; but on entering the parlour, she
                        found those who must rouse her. Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during
                        her absence, and were sitting with her father.—Mr. Knightley
                        immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual,
                        said,</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04284" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"I would not go away
                        without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be
                        gone directly. I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and
                        Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the 'love,' which
                        nobody carries?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04285" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Nothing at all. But is not
                        this a sudden scheme?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04286" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Yes— rather —I
                        have been thinking of it some little time."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04287" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma was sure he had not
                        forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.</span>

                        Time,

                        would tell
                        him that they ought to be friends again.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04291" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">While he stood, as if
                        meaning to go, but not going— her father began his
                    inquiries.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04292" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Well, my dear, and did you
                        get there safely?—And how did you find my worthy old friend and her
                        daughter?—I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for
                        coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as
                        I told you before. She is always so attentive to them!"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04293" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma's colour was heightened
                        by this unjust praise; and with a smile, and shake of the head, which spoke
                        much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.—It seemed as if there were an
                        instantaneous impression in her favour, as if his eyes received the truth
                        from hers, and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once
                        caught and honoured.— He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was
                        warmly gratified—and in another moment still more so, by a little
                        movement of more than common friendliness on his part.—He took her
                        hand;—whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not
                        say— she might, perhaps, have rather offered it— but he took her
                        hand, pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his
                        lips—when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.—Why
                        he should feel such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all
                        but done, she could not perceive.—</span>

                        He would have
                        judged better,</span>

                        indubitable; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little
                        gallantry, or however else it happened, but</span>

                        nothing
                        became him more.—It was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a
                        nature.—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04300" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She could not but recall the
                        attempt with great satisfaction.</span>

                        It spoke such
                        perfect amity.—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04302" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">He left them immediately
                        afterwards— gone in a moment. He always moved with the alertness of a
                        mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more
                        sudden than usual in his disappearance.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04303" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma could not regret her

                        she wished
                        she had left her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a great
                        pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr.

                        would have been pleasanter.—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04310" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">They parted thorough
                        friends, however; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his

                        her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.—He had been sitting
                        with them half an hour, she found.</span>

                        father's thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley's going to
                        London; and going so suddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would
                        be all very bad; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her
                        dependence on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful
                        check,—interested, without disturbing him. He had long made up his
                        mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it
                        cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected
                        blow.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04313" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"I am very glad, indeed, my
                        dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably settled. Mrs. Elton is very
                        good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say her acquaintance are just what
                        they ought to be. I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health will be
                        taken good care of. It ought to be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss
                        Taylor's always was with me. You know, my dear, she is going to be to this
                        new lady what Miss Taylor was to us. And I hope she will be better off in
                        one respect, and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so
                        long."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04314" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The following day brought
                        news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background. An express
                        arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her
                        nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account, she had
                        not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return. A sudden seizure of a
                        different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state, had carried
                        her off after a short struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no
                    more.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04315" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was felt as such things
                        must be felt. Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness
                        towards the departed, solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a
                        reasonable time, curiosity to know where she would be buried. Goldsmith
                        tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do but
                        to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be
                        recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked
                        at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of with compassionate allowances.
                        In one point she was fully justified. She had never been admitted before to
                        be seriously ill. The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all
                        the selfishness of imaginary complaints.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04316" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Weston" data-placement="auto top">"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no
                        doubt she had been suffering a great deal: more than any body had ever
                        supposed—and continual pain would try the temper. It was a sad
                        event— a great shock— with all her faults, what would Mr.
                        Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would be dreadful indeed. Mr.
                        Churchill would never get over it."—</span>

                    <span id="said_no_04319" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and resolved, that his
                        mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and

                        steady. How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both.
                        It was also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs.
                        Churchill, the grief of her husband—</span>

                        Now, an
                        attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill,
                        independent of his wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be
                        persuaded into any thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was,
                        that the nephew should form the attachment,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_04326" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">as, with all her goodwill in
                        the cause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already
                    formed.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_04327" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Harriet behaved extremely
                        well on the occasion, with great self-command. What ever she might feel of
                        brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a
                        proof in her of strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that
                        might endanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's
                        death with mutual forbearance.</span></p>

                        suffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which
                        made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time
                        proposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged
                        —appetite quite gone— and though there were no absolutely
                        alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the
                        standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He
                        thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it
                        so herself, though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her
                        present home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous
                        disorder:—confined always to one room;—he could have wished it
                        otherwise— and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must
                        acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description.
                        Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact, only too
                        great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good
                        from them.</span>
