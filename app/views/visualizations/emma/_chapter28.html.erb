                        and Jane Fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her

                <p><span id="said_no_02592" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Shortly afterwards Miss

                <p><span id="said_no_02593" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"Mr. Knightley I
                        declare!â€”I must speak to him if possible, just to thank him. I will
                        not open the window here; it would give you all cold; but I can go into my
                        mother's room you know. I dare say he will come in when he knows who is
                        here. Quite delightful to have you all meet so!â€”Our little room so
                        honoured!"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02594" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was in the adjoining
                        chamber while she still spoke, and opening the casement there, immediately
                        called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every syllable of their conversation
                        was as distinctly heard by the others, as if it had passed within the same
                        apartment.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02595" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"How d' ye do?â€”how d'ye

                        night. We were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Pray come in; do
                        come in. You will find some friends here."</span></p>

                        Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and
                        commandingly did he say,</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02597" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"How is your niece, Miss

                        How is Miss Fairfax?â€”I hope she caught no cold last night. How is she
                        to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02598" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">And Miss Bates was obliged to
                        give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else. The
                        listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular
                        meaning. But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism.</span></p>
