                        and Jane Fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her

                            wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be persuaded to

                        precise day of the instrument's coming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel
                        Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?—Do
                        you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or

                        <em>Adair</em> at this moment— <em>his</em> favourite."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02592" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Shortly afterwards Miss
                        Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far
                        off.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02593" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"Mr. Knightley I
                        declare!—I must speak to him if possible, just to thank him. I will
                        not open the window here; it would give you all cold; but I can go into my
                        mother's room you know. I dare say he will come in when he knows who is
                        here. Quite delightful to have you all meet so!—Our little room so
                        honoured!"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02594" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was in the adjoining
                        chamber while she still spoke, and opening the casement there, immediately
                        called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every syllable of their conversation
                        was as distinctly heard by the others, as if it had passed within the same
                        apartment.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02595" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"How d' ye do?—how d'ye
                        do?—Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you for the carriage last
                        night. We were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Pray come in; do
                        come in. You will find some friends here."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02596" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">So began Miss Bates; and Mr.
                        Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and
                        commandingly did he say,</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02597" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"How is your niece, Miss
                        Bates?—I want to inquire after you all, but particularly your niece.
                        How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no cold last night. How is she
                        to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02598" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">And Miss Bates was obliged to
                        give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else. The
                        listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular
                        meaning. But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02599" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"So obliged to you!—so
                        very much obliged to you for the carriage," resumed Miss Bates.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02600" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">He cut her short

                        in. Who do you think is here?—Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind
                        as to call to hear the new pianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown,
                        and come in."</span></p>

                            well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player, without
                            exception, in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they
                            will say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot
