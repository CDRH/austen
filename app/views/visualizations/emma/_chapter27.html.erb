                <p><span id="said_no_02377" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma did not repent her
                        condescension in going to the Coles. The visit afforded her many pleasant
                        recollections the next day; and all that she might be supposed to have lost
                        on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of
                        popularity.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02378" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        She must have
                        delighted the Coles— worthy people, who deserved to be made
                        happy!—And left a name behind her that would not soon die
                    away.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02379" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Perfect happiness, even in
                        memory, is not common; and there were two points on which she was not quite
                        easy. She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by
                        woman, in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank
                        Churchill.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02380" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        It was hardly
                        right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his
                        submission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which
                        made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held
                        her tongue.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02381" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The other circumstance of
                        regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and there she had no doubt. She did
                        unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and
                        singing. She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her
                        childhood—and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a
                        half.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02382" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was then interrupted by
                        Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise could have satisfied her, she
                        might soon have been comforted.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02383" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Harriet Smith" data-placement="auto top">"Oh! if I could but play as
                        well as you and Miss Fairfax!"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02384" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Don't class us together,
                        Harriet. My playing is no more like her's, than a lamp is like
                        sunshine."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02385" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Harriet Smith" data-placement="auto top">"Oh! dear—I think you
                        play the best of the two. I think you play quite as well as she does. I am
                        sure I had much rather hear you. Every body last night said how well you
                        played."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02386" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Those who knew any thing
                        about it, must have felt the difference. The truth is, Harriet, that my
                        playing is just good enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond
                        it."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02387" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Harriet Smith" data-placement="auto top">"Well, I always shall think
                        that you play quite as well as she does, or that if there is any difference
                        nobody would ever find it out.</span>

                        he valued
                        taste much more than execution."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02395" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has
                        them both, Harriet."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02396" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Harriet Smith" data-placement="auto top">"Are you sure? I saw she had
                        execution, but I did not know she had any taste. Nobody talked about it. And
                        I hate Italian singing.—There is no understanding a word of it.
                        Besides, if she does play so very well, you know, it is no more than she is
                        obliged to do, because she will have to teach.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02397" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Harriet Smith" data-placement="auto top">The Coxes were

                        either of
                        the Coxes would be very glad to marry him."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02422" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Very likely.—I think
                        they are, without exception, the most vulgar girls in Highbury."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02423" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Harriet had business at
                        Ford's.—Emma thought it most prudent to go with her. Another
                        accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in her present state,
                        would be dangerous.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02424" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Harriet, tempted by every
                        thing and swayed by half a word, was always very long at a purchase; and
                        while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind, Emma went to
                        the door for amusement.—Much could not be hoped from the traffic of
                        even the busiest part of Highbury;—Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr.
                        William Cox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's
                        carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an
                        obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect; and
                        when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman
                        travelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling
                        over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker's
                        little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to
                        complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A
                        mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing
                        that does not answer.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_02425" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She looked down the Randalls
                        road. The scene enlarged; two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her
                        son-in-law; they were walking into Highbury;—to Hartfield of course.
                        They were stopping, however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house
                        was a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma
                        caught their eye.—Immediately they crossed the road and came forward
                        to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh
                        pleasure to the present meeting.</span>

                            says I did, I am going now."</span></p>

                        answer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from
                        them. And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for what is our

                        let my mother know how little she eats—so I say one thing and then I
                        say another, and it passes off. But about the middle of the day she gets
                        hungry, and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples, and
                        they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other day of
                        asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any
                        doubt before— — I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked
                        apple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit
                        thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty
                        makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I
                        hope, and these ladies will oblige us."</span></p>

                    <span id="said_no_02506" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">That, you know, was so

                        very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice— only
                        we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise
                        to have them done three times—but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as
                        not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest sort for
                        baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell —some of Mr. Knightley's most
                        liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was
                        such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees— I believe there is
                        two of them.</span>

                        enjoyed them, and</span>

                        some more, before they get good for nothing.'</span>

                        —for really as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we
                        had a great many left— it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should
                        be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending
                        us more, so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when
                        he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me— No, I should not say
                        quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite
                        distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone;</span>

                        I had made

                        say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William Larkins came
                        over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at
                        least, and I was very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William
                        Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an
                        old acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however,</span>

                        long as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the
