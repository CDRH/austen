                        come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified
                        in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For the present, he could not be
                        spared, to his</span>

                        and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls
                        at no distant period."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01483" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Weston was exceedingly
                        disappointed— — much more disappointed, in fact, than her husband,
                        though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober:
                        but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does
                        not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression. It soon flies
                        over the present failure, and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr.
                        Weston was surprized and sorry; but then</span>

                        that</span>

                        Frank's
                        coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of
                        year; better weather; and</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01486" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">that</span>

                        he would be
                        able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he
                        had come sooner.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01488" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">These feelings rapidly
                        restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a more apprehensive disposition,
                        foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her
                        concern for what her husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more
                        herself.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01489" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma was not at this time in
                        a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming,
                        except as a disappointment at Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no
                        charm for her. She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but
                        still, as it was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her
                        usual self, she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance,
                        and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might
                        naturally belong to their friendship.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01490" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was the first to announce
                        it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, (or,
                        being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills,
                        in keeping him away.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01492" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">a good deal more than she
                        felt,</span>

                        the advantage
                        of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of
                        looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of
                        him would have made;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01495" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and ending with reflections
                        on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement
                        with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was
                        taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making use
                        of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01496" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"The Churchills are
                            very likely in fault,"</span>

                        <span id="said_no_01498" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"but I dare say he
                            might come if he would."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01499" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"I do not know why you should
                        say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare
                        him."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01500" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"I cannot believe that he
                        has not the power of coming, if he made a point of it. It is too unlikely,
                        for me to believe it without proof."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01501" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"How odd you are! What has
                        Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural
                        creature?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01502" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"I am not supposing him at
                        all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above
                        his connexions, and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure,
                        from living with those who have always set him the example of it. It is a
                        great deal more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by
                        those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and
                        selfish too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have
                        contrived it between September and January. A man at his age— what is
                        he?—three or four-and-twenty— cannot be without the means of
                        doing as much as that. It is impossible."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01503" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"That's easily said, and
                        easily felt by you, who have always been your own master. You are the worst
                        judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence. You do
                        not know what it is to have tempers to manage."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01504" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"It is not to be conceived
                        that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or
                        limb to that amount. He cannot want money— he cannot want leisure. We
                        know, on the contrary, that he has so much of both, that he is glad to get
                        rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at
                        some watering-place or other. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This
                        proves that he can leave the Churchills."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01505" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Yes, sometimes he
                        can."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01506" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"And those times are
                        whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of
                        pleasure."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01507" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"It is very unfair to judge
                        of any body's conduct, without an intimate knowledge of their situation.
                        Nobody, who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what the
                        difficulties of any individual of that family may be. We ought to be
                        acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's temper, before we
                        pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do. He may, at times, be able to
                        do a great deal more than he can at others."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01508" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"There is one thing, Emma,
                        which a man can always do, if he chuses, and that is, his duty; not by
                        manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution. It is Frank
                        Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his father. He knows it to be so,
                        by his promises and messages; but if he wished to do it, it might be done. A
                        man who felt rightly would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs.
                        Churchill—'Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me
                        ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my father
                        immediately. I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect
                        to him on the present occasion. I shall, therefore, set off
                        to-morrow.'—If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision
                        becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his going."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01509" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"No,"</span>

                            laughing;</span>
                        <span id="said_no_01511" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"but perhaps there might
                            be some made to his coming back again. Such language for a young man
                            entirely dependent, to use!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would
                            imagine it possible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite in
                            situations directly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be
                            making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him
                            up, and are to provide for him!—Standing up in the middle of the
                            room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!—How can you
                            imagine such conduct practicable?"</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01512" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Depend upon it, Emma, a
                        sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He would feel himself in the
                        right; and the declaration —made, of course, as a man of sense would
                        make it, in a proper manner —would do him more good, raise him higher,
                        fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on, than all that a
                        line of shifts and expedients can ever do. Respect would be added to
                        affection. They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who
                        had done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as
                        well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he ought to pay
                        this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it,
                        are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their
                        whims. Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in
                        this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little
                        minds would bend to his."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01513" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"I rather doubt that. You are
                        very fond of bending little minds; but where little minds belong to rich
                        people in authority, I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they
                        are quite as unmanageable as great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you
                        are, Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr.
                        Frank Churchill's situation, you would be able to say and do just what you
                        have been recommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The
                        Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would have
                        no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through. To him
                        who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect
                        independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at
                        nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can
                        have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to
                        it."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01514" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Then it would not be so
                        strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal exertion, it could not be an
                        equal conviction."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01515" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Emma Woodhouse" data-placement="auto top">"Oh, the difference of
                        situation and habit! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable
                        young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those, whom as child
                        and boy he has been looking up to all his life."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01516" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Our amiable young man is a
                        very weak young man, if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a
                        resolution to do right against the will of others. It ought to have been a
                        habit with him by this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting
                        expediency. I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man. As
                        he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that
                        was unworthy in their authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt
                        on their side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there
                        would have been no difficulty now."</span></p>

                            extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:
                            I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,
                            though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,
                            complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's
                            perfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some
                            advantages, it will secure him many others."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_01520" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Knightley" data-placement="auto top">"Yes; all the advantages of
                        sitting still when he ought to move, and of leading a life of mere idle
                        pleasure, and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it.
                        He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and
                        falsehoods, and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method
                        in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's having
                        any right to complain. His letters disgust me."</span></p>

                        satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and
                        quick feelings: standing in a mother's place, but without a mother's
                        affection to blind her. It is on her account that attention to Randalls is
                        doubly due, and she must doubly feel the omission. Had she been a person of
                        consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would not have
                        signified whether he did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in
                        these sort of considerations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this
                        to herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French,
                        not in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good manners, and be
                        very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of
                        other people: nothing really amiable about him."</span></p>

                            is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible

                        ask for all the virtues into the bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley,
                        what a <em>sensation</em> his coming will produce? There will
                        be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one
                        interest— one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill;
                        we shall think and speak of nobody else."</span></p>

                        farming; to me, of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that
                        general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the
                        lead, or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak
                        extremely well on each; that is my idea of him."</span></p>
