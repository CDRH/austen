                            in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the first chat of

                                It seems an impossibility!—You cannot mean to say, that

                            delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was</span>

                            the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be our brother and
                            sister, Henry, John—and Miss Smith.</span>

                            and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day— which he
                            did —and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an
                            opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in
                            vain.—She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is
                            deserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this
                            morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first on
                            my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of the
                            how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer
                            history when you see her.—She will give you all the minute
                            particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.—In
                            our communications we deal only in the great.—However, I must say,

                            which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the blind, of two

                            were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see him—but there was
                            a degree of confusion— a number of embarrassing recollections on
                            each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a consciousness which
                            at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat down again, there
                            was for some time such a blank in the circle, that Emma began to doubt
                            whether the wish now indulged, which she had long felt, of seeing Frank
                            Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its
                            proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and
                            when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or
                            animation— or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to
                            draw near her and say,</span></p>
