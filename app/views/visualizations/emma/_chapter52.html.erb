                <p><span id="said_no_05107" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was a very great relief to
                        Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting. Their
                        intercourse was painful enough by letter.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05108" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        How much
                        worse, had they been obliged to meet!</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05109" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Harriet expressed herself
                        very much as might be supposed, without reproaches, or apparent sense of
                        ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment, a
                        something bordering on it in her style, which increased the desirableness of
                        their being separate.—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05110" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        It might be
                        only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have
                        been quite without resentment under such a stroke.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05111" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She had no difficulty in
                        procuring Isabella's invitation; and she was fortunate in having a
                        sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting to invention.—There
                        was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to
                        consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing
                        of ill health was a recommendation to her—and though not so fond of a
                        dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under her
                        care.—When it was thus settled on her sister's side, Emma proposed it
                        to her friend, and found her very persuadable.—Harriet was to go; she
                        was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr.
                        Woodhouse's carriage.—It was all arranged, it was all completed, and
                        Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05112" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy
                        Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could talk, and she could listen with true
                        happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most
                        painful, which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was
                        near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be
                        enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05113" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">The difference of Harriet at
                        Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in
                        Emma's sensations; but she could not think of her in London without objects
                        of curiosity and employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying
                        her out of herself.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05114" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She would not allow any other
                        anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had
                        occupied.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05115" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        There was a
                        communication before her, one which <em>she</em> only could be
                        competent to make— the confession of her engagement to her
                        father;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05116" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">but she would have nothing
                        to do with it at present.—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05117" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She had resolved</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05118" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        to defer the
                        disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation
                        should be thrown at this period among those she loved—and the evil
                        should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.—A
                        fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer,
                        but more agitating, delight, should be hers.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05119" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She soon resolved, equally as
                        a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in
                        calling on Miss Fairfax.—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05120" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_emma" data-placement="auto top">
                        She ought to
                        go—and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present
                        situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a <em>secret</em> satisfaction; but the consciousness of a
                        similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she
                        should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05121" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She went— she had
                        driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not been into the house
                        since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had been in such distress
                        as had filled her with compassion, though all the worst of her sufferings
                        had been unsuspected.—The fear of being still unwelcome, determined
                        her, though</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05122" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">assured of</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05123" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar_patty" data-placement="auto top">
                        their being
                        at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05124" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She heard Patty announcing
                        it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so
                        happily intelligible.—No; she heard nothing but the instant reply
                        of,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05125" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Fairfax" data-placement="auto top">"Beg her to walk
                        up;"—</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05126" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">and a moment afterwards she
                        was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no
                        other reception of her were felt sufficient.—Emma had never seen her
                        look so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness, animation,
                        and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever
                        have wanted.— She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a
                        low, but very feeling tone,</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05127" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jane Fairfax" data-placement="auto top">"This is most kind,
                        indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to express— I
                        hope you will believe— Excuse me for being so entirely without
                        words."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05128" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma was gratified, and would
                        soon have shewn no want of words, if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from
                        the sitting-room had not checked her, and made it expedient to compress all
                        her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest
                        shake of the hand.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05129" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton
                        were together. Miss Bates was out, which accounted for the previous
                        tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a
                        humour to have patience with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with
                        unusual graciousness, she hoped the rencontre would do them no
                    harm.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05130" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">She soon believed
                        herself</span>

                        to penetrate
                        Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and understand why she was, like herself, in happy
                        spirits; it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself
                        acquainted with what was still a secret to other people.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_05132" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma saw symptoms of it
                        immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her own
                        compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's
                        replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a
                        letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and
                        return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with
                        significant nods,</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05133" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"We can finish this some
                        other time, you know. You and I shall not want opportunities. And, in fact,
                        you have heard all the essential already. I only wanted to prove to you that
                        Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is not offended. You see how delightfully
                        she writes. Oh! she is a sweet creature! You would have doated on her, had
                        you gone.—But not a word more. Let us be discreet— quite on our
                        good behaviour.—Hush!—You remember those lines— I forget
                        the poem at this moment:</span></p>

                <div class="lg">
                    <div class="l"> "For when a lady's in the case, </div>
                    <div class="l"> "You know all other things give place." </div>

                <p><span id="said_no_05134" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">Now I say, my dear, in <em>our</em> case, for <em>lady</em>,
                        read—— mum! a word to the wise.—I am in a fine flow of
                        spirits, an't I? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs.
                            S.—<em>My</em> representation, you see, has quite
                        appeased her."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05135" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">And again, on Emma's merely
                        turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half
                        whisper,</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05136" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Elton" data-placement="auto top">"I mentioned no <em>names</em>, you will observe.—Oh! no; cautious as a
                        minister of state. I managed it extremely well."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05137" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Emma could not doubt. It was
                        a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion. When they had all
                        talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found
                        herself abruptly addressed with,</span></p>

                            saying something to Emma, whispered farther,</span>

                            Hill. Very pleasant party. But yet I think there was something wanting.
                            Things did not seem— that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the
                            spirits of some.—So it appeared to me at least, but I might be
                            mistaken. However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go
                            again. What say you both to our collecting the same party, and exploring
                            to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?—It must be the
                            same party, you know, quite the same party, not <em>one</em> exception."</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05146" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Soon after this Miss Bates
                        came in, and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her
                        first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed, from doubt of what might
                        be said, and impatience to say every thing.</span></p>

                <p><span id="said_no_05147" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Miss Bates" data-placement="auto top">"Thank you, dear Miss

                        deal with. You knew I should not stir till my lord and master

                            sense would have rendered her, to the advice which would have saved her
                            from the worst of all her womanly follies— — her wilful intimacy
                            with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a subject.—She could not
                            enter on it.—Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them. This,
                            on his side, might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but
                            Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion,
                            from some appearances, that their friendship were declining. She was
                            aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they
                            certainly should have corresponded more, and that her intelligence would
                            not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on Isabella's letters. He
                            might observe that it was so. The pain of being obliged to practise
                            concealment towards him, was very little inferior to the pain of having
                            made Harriet unhappy.</span></p>

                            good an account of her visitor as could be expected; on her first
                            arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which appeared perfectly
                            natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that
                            business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet different
                            from what she had known her before.—Isabella, to be sure, was no
                            very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with
                            the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma's comforts and hopes
                            were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer; her
                            fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley
                            were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain till they

                        world.</span></p>

                    <p><span id="said_no_05296" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Poor man!—it was at
                            first a considerable shock to him, and he tried earnestly to dissuade
                            her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of having always said she
                            would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal better for
                            her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss
                            Taylor.—But it would not do. Emma hung about him affectionately,
                            and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with
                            Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield,
                            had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not going from
                            Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing no change in
                            their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very
                            sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley
                            always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.—Did he not
                            love Mr. Knightley very much?—He would not deny that he did, she
                            was sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr.
                            Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his
                            letters, who so glad to assist him?—Who so cheerful, so attentive,
                            so attached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the
                            spot?—Yes. That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be
                            there too often; he should be glad to see him every day;—but they
                            did see him every day as it was.—Why could not they go on as they
                            had done?</span></p>

                    <p><span id="said_no_05297" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Woodhouse could not
                            be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time
                            and continual repetition must do the rest.—To Emma's entreaties
                            and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond praise of her gave
                            the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to
                            by each, on every fair occasion.—They had all the assistance which
                            Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs.
                            Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the
                            most serviceable light— first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a
                            good one —well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two
                            recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.—It was agreed upon, as
                            what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring
                            him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself
                            which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or
                            other— in another year or two, perhaps— it might not be so
                            very bad if the marriage did take place.</span></p>

                    <p><span id="said_no_05298" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.005.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Weston was acting no
                            part, feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the
                            event.—She had been extremely surprized, never more so, than when
                            Emma first opened the affair to her; but she saw in it only increase of
                            happiness to all, and had no scruple in urging him to the
                            utmost.—She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as to think he
                            deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper,
                            suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point
                            of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible, so singularly
                            fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached
                            herself to any other creature, and that she had herself been the
                            stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it long
                            ago.—How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma
                            would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.
                            Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an
                            arrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.
                            Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a
                            marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe
                            and Hartfield had been a continual impediment — —less acknowledged
                            by Mr. Weston than by herself— — but even he had never been able
                            to finish the subject better than by saying—</span>

                            nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was

                            It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without
                            one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.</span></p>

                            was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of

                            quickness of mind.—He saw the advantages of the match, and
                            rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of
                            it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he was not far from

                            her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole,
                            Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately afterwards. It was no more than

                            Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter's courage failed.
