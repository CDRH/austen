            made more than a momentary impression on his uncle. The hope of an opportunity, which
            Sir Thomas had then given, was not given to be thought of no more. He remained steadily
            inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling;</span>

            to gratify anybody else
            who might wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the young people in
            general;</span>
          <span id="said_no_02538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and having thought the matter over,
            and taken his resolution in quiet independence, the result of it appeared the next
            morning at breakfast, when, after recalling and commending what his nephew had said, he
            added, </span>
          <span id="said_no_02539" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sir Thomas Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I do not like, William, that you
            should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence. It would give me pleasure to see
            you both dance. You spoke of the balls at Northampton. Your cousins have occasionally
            attended them; but they would not altogether suit us now. The fatigue would be too much
            for your aunt. I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball. A dance at home would
            be more eligible; and ifâ€”"</span>

            <span id="said_no_02541" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">interrupted Mrs. Norris, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02542" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"I knew what was coming. I knew what
              you were going to say. If dear Julia were at home, or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at
              Sotherton, to afford a reason, an occasion for such a thing, you would be tempted to
              give the young people a dance at Mansfield. I know you would. If <em>they</em> were at home to grace the ball, a ball you would have this very
              Christmas. Thank your uncle, William, thank your uncle!"</span>

              and I hope are very happy; but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield will be
              for their cousins. Could we be all assembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be
              more complete, but the absence of some is not to debar the others of
              amusement."</span>

          <span id="said_no_02546" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Norris had not another word to
            say. She saw decision in his looks, and her surprise and vexation required some minutes'
            silence to be settled into composure.</span>

            A ball at such a time! His

          <span id="said_no_02548" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was comfort, however, soon at

            <em>She</em> must be the doer of everything: Lady Bertram would of course
            be spared all thought and exertion, and it would all fall upon <em>her</em>. She should have to do the honours of the evening;</span>
          <span id="said_no_02550" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and this reflection quickly restored
            so much of her good-humour as enabled her to join in with the others, before their
            happiness and thanks were all expressed.</span>

          <span id="said_no_02551" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in
            their different ways, look and speak as much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as
            Sir Thomas could desire.</span>

            and contented, and had no objections to make. Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very

          <span id="said_no_02559" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">but found it all prearranged; and when

            a very complete outline of the business; and as soon as she would listen quietly, could

            William was required to be
            at Portsmouth on the 24th; the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his visit; but
            where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any earlier.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02566" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Norris was obliged to be

            of proposing the 22nd herself, as by far the best day for the purpose.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02569" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The ball was now a settled thing, and
            before the evening a proclaimed thing to all whom it concerned. Invitations were sent
            with despatch, and many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of happy
            cares as well as Fanny.</span>

          <span id="said_no_02573" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">was a point of painful

          <span id="said_no_02574" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>

            the almost solitary
            ornament in her possession, a very pretty amber cross which William had brought her from
            Sicily,</span>
          <span id="said_no_02576" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">was the greatest distress of
            all,</span>

            for she had nothing but a
            bit of ribbon to fasten it to; and though she had worn it in that manner once, would it
            be allowable at such a time in the midst of all the rich ornaments which she supposed
            all the other young ladies would appear in? And yet not to wear it! William had wanted
            to buy her a gold chain too, but the purchase had been beyond his means, and therefore
            not to wear the cross might be mortifying him.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02578" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">These were anxious considerations;
            enough to sober her spirits even under the prospect of a ball given principally for her
            gratification.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span id="said_no_02579" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The preparations meanwhile went on,
            and Lady Bertram continued to sit on her sofa without any inconvenience from them. She
            had some extra visits from the housekeeper, and her maid was rather hurried in making up
            a new dress for her: Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran about; but all this
            gave <em>her</em> no trouble, and as she had foreseen,</span> "there was,
          in fact, no trouble in the business." </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02580" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edmund was at this time particularly
            full of cares: his mind being deeply occupied in the consideration of two important
            events now at hand, which were to fix his fate in lifeâ€” ordination and matrimonyâ€” events
            of such a serious character as to make the ball, which would be very quickly followed by
            one of them, appear of less moment in his eyes than in those of any other person in the
            house. On the 23rd he was going to a friend near Peterborough, in the same situation as
            himself, and they were to receive ordination in the course of the Christmas week.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02581" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            Half his destiny would then
            be determined, but the other half might not be so very smoothly wooed. His duties would
            be established, but the wife who was to share, and animate, and reward those duties,
            might yet be unattainable.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02582" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He knew his own mind, but he was not
            always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford's.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02583" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            There were points on which
            they did not quite agree; there were moments in which she did not seem propitious; and
            though trusting altogether to her affection, so far as to be resolvedâ€” almost resolved
            â€”on bringing it to a decision within a very short time, as soon as the variety of
            business before him were arranged, and he knew what he had to offer her,</span>
          <span id="said_no_02584" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he had many anxious feelings, many
            doubting hours as to the result. His conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very
            strong; he could look back on a long course of encouragement, and she was as perfect in
            disinterested attachment as in everything else. But at other times doubt and alarm
            intermingled with his hopes; and when</span>
          <span id="said_no_02585" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he thought of</span>

            her acknowledged
            disinclination for privacy and retirement, her decided preference of a London

            what could he expect but a

          <span id="said_no_02588" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            unless it were an
            acceptance even more to be deprecated, demanding such sacrifices of situation and
            employment on his side as conscience must forbid.</span>

            The issue of all depended on
            one question. Did she love him well enough to forego what had used to be essential

            But this had occurred on

            arrange, and re-arrange, Edmund could not, on his own account, think very much of the
            evening which the rest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of
            strong interest. Independent of his two cousins' enjoyment in it, the evening was to him
            of no higher value than any other appointed meeting of the two families might be. In
            every meeting there was a hope of receiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford's
            attachment; but the whirl of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable to the
            excitement or expression of serious feelings. To engage her early for the two first
            dances was all the command of individual happiness which he felt in his power, and the
            only preparation for the ball which he could enter into, in spite of all that was
            passing around him on the subject, from morning till night.</span>

            on Wednesday morning Fanny, still unable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to
            wear, determined to seek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant
            and her sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless; and as
            Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she had reason to think Mr. Crawford
            likewise out, she walked down to the Parsonage without much fear of wanting an
            opportunity for private discussion; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most
            important part of it to Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own

            and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready and kind attention, they
            proceeded indoors, and upstairs, and were soon deep in the interesting subject. Miss
            Crawford, pleased with the appeal, gave her all her best judgment and taste, made
            everything easy by her suggestions, and tried to make everything agreeable by her
            encouragement. The dress being settled in all its grander partsâ€”</span>

            last, by fancying there was one necklace more frequently placed before her eyes than the

            and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped, in fixing on this, to be
            chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep. Miss Crawford smiled her perfect
            approbation; and hastened to complete the gift by putting the necklace round her, and
            making her see how well it looked. Fanny had not a word to say against its becomingness,
            and, excepting what remained of her scruples, was exceedingly pleased with an
            acquisition so very apropos. She would rather, perhaps, have been obliged to some other
