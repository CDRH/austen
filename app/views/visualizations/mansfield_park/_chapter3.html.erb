          <span id="said_no_00150" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The first event of any importance in
            the family was the death of Mr. Norris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and
            necessarily introduced alterations and novelties. Mrs. Norris, on quitting the
            Parsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house of Sir Thomas's in
            the village, and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she
            could do very well without him; and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity
            of stricter economy.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00151" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The living was hereafter for Edmund;
            and, had his uncle died a few years sooner, it would have been duly given to some friend
            to hold till he were old enough for orders. But Tom's extravagance had, previous to that
            event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation
            necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder.
            There was another family living actually held for Edmund; but though this circumstance
            had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas's conscience, he could not but
            feel it to be an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with
            the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had
            yet been able to say or do.</span>

              am driven on, and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion. You
              have robbed Edmund for ten, twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half
              the income which ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (I hope
              it will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not be forgotten that no
              benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us, and that nothing
              can, in fact, be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to
              forego through the urgency of your debts."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00170" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The time was now come when Sir Thomas
            expected his sister-in-law to claim her share in their niece, the change in Mrs.
            Norris's situation, and the improvement in Fanny's age, seeming not merely to do away
            any former objection to their living together, but even to give it the most decided
            eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than heretofore, by
            some recent losses on his West India estate, in addition to his eldest son's
            extravagance, it became not undesirable to himself to be relieved from the expense of
            her support, and the obligation of her future provision. In the fullness of his belief
            that such a thing must be, he mentioned its probability to his wife; and the first time
            of the subject's occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present, she
            calmly observed to her, </span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00172" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny was too much surprised to do

            astonished? You have been five years with us, and my sister always meant to take you

            My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you. She is choosing a friend and

            as a child; but it was the same with us all, or nearly so. She never knew how to be
            pleasant to children. But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she is
            behaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you <em>must</em> be important to her."</span>

            my dear Fanny, believe me, you never have a shadow of either, but in using the words so
            improperly. There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you
            are known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure you have a grateful
            heart, that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it. I do not know any

            remembered at such a distance as the White House. You speak as if you were going two
            hundred miles off instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost as
            much as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in the year. The only
            difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will necessarily be brought forward
            as you ought to be. <em>Here</em> there are too many whom you can hide
            behind; but with <em>her</em> you will be forced to speak for
            yourself."</span>

            pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you
            now. She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself
            about, and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers."</span>

            ought to believe you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obliged to you
            for trying to reconcile me to what must be. If I could suppose my aunt really to care
            for me, it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody. <em>Here</em>, I know, I am of none, and yet I love the place so

            quit, though you quit the house. You will have as free a command of the park and gardens
            as ever. Even <em>your</em> constant little heart need not take fright at
            such a nominal change. You will have the same walks to frequent, the same library to
            choose from, the same people to look at, the same horse to ride."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00207" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"Very true. Yes, dear old grey pony!
            Ah! cousin, when I remember how much I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to
            hear it talked of as likely to do me good (oh! how I have trembled at my uncle's opening
            his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind pains you took to reason
            and persuade me out of my fears, and convince me that I should like it after a little
            while, and feel how right you proved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always
            prophesy as well."</span>

            being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health,
            and as much for your ultimate happiness too."</span>

            any very appropriate service it could render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for
            Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her. It had never occurred to her,
            on the present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. To prevent its being
            expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank as genteel among the
            buildings of Mansfield parish, the White House being only just large enough to receive
            herself and her servants, and allow a spare room for a friend, of which she made a very
            particular point. The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been wanted, but the
            absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now never forgotten. Not all her
            precautions, however, could save her from being suspected of something better; or,
            perhaps, her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas
            to suppose it really intended for Fanny. Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a
            certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris—</span>

            could I do with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for anything, my
            spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl at her time of life? A girl of
            fifteen! the very age of all others to need most attention and care, and put the
            cheerfullest spirits to the test! Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a

            spirits still worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to support
            me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory
            of the dear departed— what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me
            as Fanny? If I could wish it for my own sake, I would not do so unjust a thing by the

            <em>been</em> a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed to
            practise economy now. My situation is as much altered as my income. A great many things
            were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the parish, that cannot be expected from
            me. It is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At the
            White House, matters must be better looked after. I <em>must</em> live
            within my income, or I shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction
            to be able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year."</span>

          <span id="said_no_00233" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"Well, Lady Bertram,"</span> said
            Mrs. Norris, moving to go, <span id="said_no_00234" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"I can
              only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir Thomas
              should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able to say that my health
              and spirits put it quite out of the question; besides that, I really should not have a
              bed to give her, for I must keep a spare room for a friend."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00235" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lady Bertram repeated enough of this
            conversation to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law's
            views; and she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the
            slightest allusion to it from him. He could not but wonder at her refusing to do
            anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt; but, as she took early care
            to make him, as well as Lady Bertram, understand that whatever she possessed was
            designed for their family, he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which, at the same
            time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable him better to
            provide for Fanny himself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00236" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had
            been her fears of a removal; and her spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery,
            conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be
            so essentially serviceable to her. Mrs. Norris took possession of the White House, the
            Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events over, everything at Mansfield went on
            for some time as usual.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00237" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Grants showing a disposition to be
            friendly and sociable, gave great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance.
            They had their faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out. The Doctor was very fond of
            eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant, instead of contriving to
            gratify him at little expense, gave her cook as high wages as they did at Mansfield
            Park, and was scarcely ever seen in her offices. Mrs. Norris could not speak with any
            temper of such grievances, nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly
            consumed in the house. </span>
          <span id="said_no_00238" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"Nobody loved plenty and hospitality
            more than herself; nobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she believed, had
            never been wanting in comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad character in <em>her</em>
            <em>time</em>, but this was a way of going on that she could not
            understand. A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place. <em>Her</em> store-room, she thought, might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go
            into. Inquire where she would, she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more
            than five thousand pounds."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00239" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lady Bertram listened without much
            interest to this sort of invective. She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist,
            but she felt all the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant's being so well settled in life
            without being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often,
            though not so diffusely, as Mrs. Norris discussed the other.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00240" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">These opinions had been hardly
            canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family, as might
            fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies. Sir Thomas found
            it expedient to go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement of his affairs, and he
            took his eldest son with him, in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions at
            home. They left England with the probability of being nearly a twelvemonth
            absent.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00241" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The necessity of the measure in a
            pecuniary light, and the hope of its utility to his son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the
            effort of quitting the rest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction
            of others at their present most interesting time of life. He could not think Lady
            Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or rather, to perform what should
            have been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris's watchful attention, and in Edmund's judgment,
            he had sufficient confidence to make him go without fears for their conduct.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00242" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lady Bertram did not at all like to
            have her husband leave her; but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety, or
            solicitude for his comfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be
            dangerous, or difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00243" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Miss Bertrams were much to be
            pitied on the occasion: not for their sorrow, but for their want of it. Their father was
            no object of love to them; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his
            absence was unhappily most welcome. They were relieved by it from all restraint; and
            without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been forbidden by Sir
            Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal, and to have every
            indulgence within their reach. Fanny's relief, and her consciousness of it, were quite
            equal to her cousins'; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were
            ungrateful, and she really grieved because she could not grieve.</span>
          <span id="said_no_00244" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"Sir Thomas, who had done so much for
            her and her brothers, and who was gone perhaps never to return! that she should see him
            go without a tear! it was a shameful insensibility."</span>

            he hoped she might see
            William again in the course of the ensuing winter, and had charged her to write and
            invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to
            be in England.</span>
          <span id="said_no_00249" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"This was so thoughtful and

          <span id="said_no_00250" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and would he only have smiled upon
            her, and called her "my dear Fanny," while he said it, every former frown or cold
            address might have been forgotten. But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in
            sad mortification, by adding,</span>
          <span id="said_no_00251" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sir Thomas Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"If William does come to Mansfield, I
            hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you
            parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement; though, I fear, he
            must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten." She
            cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone; and her cousins, on seeing
            her with red eyes, set her down as a hypocrite.</span>
