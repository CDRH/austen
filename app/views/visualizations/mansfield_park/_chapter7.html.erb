            <span id="said_no_00538" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss
              Crawford <em>now</em>?"</span>
            <span id="said_no_00539" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Edmund the next day, after
              thinking some time on the subject himself.</span>
            <span id="said_no_00540" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"How did you like her
              yesterday?"</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00541" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"Very well —very much. I like to hear
            her talk. She entertains me; and she is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure
            in looking at her."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00542" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"It is her countenance that is so
            attractive. She has a wonderful play of feature! But was there nothing in her
            conversation that struck you, Fanny, as not quite right?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00543" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken
            of her uncle as she did. I was quite astonished. An uncle with whom she has been living
            so many years, and who, whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother,
            treating him, they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed it!"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00544" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I thought you would be struck. It was
            very wrong; very indecorous."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00545" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"And very ungrateful, I
            think."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00546" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not
            know that her uncle has any claim to her <em>gratitude</em>; his wife
            certainly had; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt's memory which misleads
            her here. She is awkwardly circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it
            must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford, without throwing a
            shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their
            disagreements, though the Admiral's present conduct might incline one to the side of his
            wife; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely.
            I do not censure her <em>opinions</em>; but there certainly <em>is</em> impropriety in making them public."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_00547" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"Do not you think,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_00548" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">said Fanny, after a little
              consideration,</span>
            <span id="said_no_00549" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"that this impropriety is a
              reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her niece has been entirely brought up by
              her? She cannot have given her right notions of what was due to the Admiral."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00550" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"That is a fair remark. Yes, we must
            suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt; and it makes one more
            sensible of the disadvantages she has been under. But I think her present home must do
            her good. Mrs. Grant's manners are just what they ought to be. She speaks of her brother
            with a very pleasing affection."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00551" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"Yes, except as to his writing her
            such short letters. She made me almost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love
            or good-nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything
            worth reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure William would never
            have used <em>me</em> so, under any circumstances. And what right had she
            to suppose that <em>you</em> would not write long letters when you were
            absent?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00552" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"The right of a lively mind, Fanny,
            seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others; perfectly
            allowable, when untinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of
            either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or loud, or coarse.
            She is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we have been speaking of. There she
            cannot be justified. I am glad you saw it all as I did."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00553" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Having formed her mind and gained her
            affections, he had a good chance of her thinking like him; though at this period, and on
            this subject, there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a line
            of admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny could not follow. Miss
            Crawford's attractions did not lessen. The harp arrived, and rather added to her beauty,
            wit, and good-humour; for she played with the greatest obligingness, with an expression
            and taste which were peculiarly becoming, and there was something clever to be said at
            the close of every air. Edmund was at the Parsonage every day, to be indulged with his
            favourite instrument: one morning secured an invitation for the next; for the lady could
            not be unwilling to have a listener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00554" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">A young woman, pretty, lively, with a
            harp as elegant as herself, and both placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and
            opening on a little lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was enough
            to catch any man's heart. The season, the scene, the air, were all favourable to
            tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not without their use:
            it was all in harmony; and as everything will turn to account when love is once set
            going, even the sandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth looking
            at. Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he was about, Edmund was
            beginning, at the end of a week of such intercourse, to be a good deal in love; and to
            the credit of the lady it may be added that, without his being a man of the world or an
            elder brother, without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk, he
            began to be agreeable to her. She felt it to be so, though she had not foreseen, and
            could hardly understand it; for he was not pleasant by any common rule: he talked no
            nonsense; he paid no compliments; his opinions were unbending, his attentions tranquil
            and simple. There was a charm, perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness, his integrity,
            which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel, though not equal to discuss with herself.
            She did not think very much about it, however: he pleased her for the present; she liked
            to have him near her; it was enough.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00555" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was
            at the Parsonage every morning; she would gladly have been there too, might she have
            gone in uninvited and unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when
            the evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he should think it right
            to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home, while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the
            ladies of the Park; but she thought it a very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there
            to mix the wine and water for her, would rather go without it than not.</span>
          <span id="said_no_00556" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was a little surprised
            that</span>
          <span id="said_no_00557" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            he could spend so many
            hours with Miss Crawford, and not see more of the sort of fault which he had already
            observed, and of which <em>she</em> was almost always reminded by a
            something of the same nature whenever she was in her company; but so it was. Edmund was
            fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it enough that the
            Admiral had since been spared;</span>
          <span id="said_no_00558" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she scrupled to point out her own
            remarks to him, lest it should appear like ill-nature. The first actual pain which Miss
            Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride, which
            the former caught, soon after her being settled at Mansfield, from the example of the
            young ladies at the Park, and which, when Edmund's acquaintance with her increased, led
            to his encouraging the wish, and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her
            first attempts, as</span>
          <span id="said_no_00559" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            the best fitted for a
            beginner that either stable could furnish.</span>
          <span id="said_no_00560" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">No pain, no injury, however, was
            designed by him to his cousin in this offer: <em>she</em> was not to lose
            a day's exercise by it. The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour
            before her ride were to begin; and Fanny, on its being first proposed, so far from
            feeling slighted, was almost over-powered with gratitude that he should be asking her
            leave for it.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00561" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Crawford made her first essay
            with great credit to herself, and no inconvenience to Fanny. Edmund, who had taken down
            the mare and presided at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before either
            Fanny or the steady old coachman, who always attended her when she rode without her
            cousins, were ready to set forward. The second day's trial was not so guiltless. Miss
            Crawford's enjoyment of riding was such that she did not know how to leave off. Active
            and fearless, and though rather small, strongly made, she seemed formed for a
            horsewoman; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something was probably
            added in Edmund's attendance and instructions, and something more in the conviction of
            very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress, to make her unwilling to
            dismount. Fanny was ready and waiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for
            not being gone, and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared. To avoid her aunt,
            and look for him, she went out.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00562" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The houses, though scarcely half a
            mile apart, were not within sight of each other; but, by walking fifty yards from the
            hall door, she could look down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its
            demesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant's meadow she
            immediately saw the group— Edmund and Miss Crawford both on horse-back, riding side by
            side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford, with two or three grooms, standing about and
            looking on. A happy party it appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful
            beyond a doubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a sound which
            did not make <em>her</em> cheerful;</span>
          <span id="said_no_00563" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she wondered that</span>
          <span id="said_no_00564" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            Edmund should forget
            her</span>
          <span id="said_no_00565" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">, and felt a pang. She could not turn
            her eyes from the meadow; she could not help watching all that passed. At first Miss
            Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not small, at a
            foot's pace; then, at <em>her</em> apparent suggestion, they rose into a
            canter; and to Fanny's timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat.
            After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmund was close to her; he was speaking to
            her; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle; he had hold of her hand;
            she saw it, or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach.</span>
          <span id="said_no_00566" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She must not wonder at all
            this;</span>
          <span id="said_no_00567" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            what could be more
            natural than that Edmund should be making himself useful, and proving his good-nature by
            any one?</span>
          <span id="said_no_00568" class="said certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            She could not but think,
            indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble;</span>
          <span id="said_no_00569" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">that</span>
          <span id="said_no_00570" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            it would have been
            particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford,
            with all his boasted good-nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew nothing of the
            matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund.</span>
          <span id="said_no_00571" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> She began</span>

            to think it rather hard
            upon the mare to have such double duty; if she were forgotten, the poor mare should be
            remembered.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00573" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her feelings for one and the other
            were soon a little tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss
            Crawford still on horseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into
            the lane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood. She began
            then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked to meet them with a great
            anxiety to avoid the suspicion.</span>

            she looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together to the village; nor
            did her attendant do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford's great cleverness

              Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her being
              perfectly equal to it. But any morning will do for this. She would be extremely sorry

            Fanny's comfort, and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning: the party
            included all the young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly
            enjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of this sort generally
            brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield Common disposed them all for going
            somewhere else the day after. There were many other views to be shewn; and though the
            weather was hot, there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is
            always provided with a shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were spent in this
            manner, in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing the honours of its finest spots.
            Everything answered; it was all gaiety and good-humour, the heat only supplying
            inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure— till the fourth day, when the
            happiness of one of the party was exceedingly clouded.</span>

            with perfect good-humour, on Mr. Rushworth's account, who was partly expected at the
            Park that day; but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good manners were
            severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home. As Mr. Rushworth
            did <em>not</em> come, the injury was increased, and she had not even the
            relief of shewing her power over him; she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and
            cousin, and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.</span>

            the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would
            scarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was half-asleep; and even Mrs.
            Norris, discomposed by her niece's ill-humour, and having asked one or two questions
            about the dinner, which were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to
            say no more. For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of
            the night and their remarks on the stars, to think beyond themselves; but when the first
            pause came, Edmund, looking around, said, </span>

              promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son, and the poor fellow was
              waiting for me half an hour. I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself
              upon any occasion, but really I cannot do everything at once. And as for Fanny's just
              stepping down to my house for me— it is not much above a quarter of a mile —I cannot
              think I was unreasonable to ask it. How often do I pace it three times a day, early
              and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about it?"</span>

              her exercise, she would not be knocked up so soon. She has not been out on horseback
              now this long while, and I am persuaded that, when she does not ride, she ought to
              walk. If she had been riding before, I should not have asked it of her. But I thought
              it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses; for there is nothing
              so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind; and though the sun was strong,
              it was not so very hot. Between ourselves, Edmund,"</span>

              the headache there, for the heat was enough to kill anybody. It was as much as I could

              was almost too much for me."</span>

            but going quietly to another table, on which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a
            glass of Madeira to Fanny, and obliged her to drink the greater part. She wished to be
            able to decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made it easier
            to swallow than to speak.</span>

            probably had its share in her indisposition; for she had been feeling neglected, and
            been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past. As she leant on the
            sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be seen, the pain of her mind had
            been much beyond that in her head; and the sudden change which Edmund's kindness had
            then occasioned, made her hardly know how to support herself.</span>
