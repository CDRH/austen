          <span id="said_no_02913" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The ball was over, and the breakfast
            was soon over too; the last kiss was given, and William was gone. Mr. Crawford had, as
            he foretold, been very punctual, and short and pleasant had been the meal.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02914" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">After seeing William to the last
            moment, Fanny walked back to the breakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve
            over the melancholy change; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace,
            conceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender
            enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William's plate might
            but divide her feelings with the broken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford's. She sat and cried
              <em>con</em>
            <em>amore</em> as her uncle intended, but it was <em>con</em>
            <em>amore</em> fraternal and no other. William was gone, and</span>
          <span id="said_no_02915" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she now felt</span>
          <span id="said_no_02916" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            as if she had wasted
            half his visit in idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02917" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny's disposition was such that she
            could never even think of her aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own
            small house, without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her when
            they had been last together; much less could her feelings acquit her of having done and
            said and thought everything by William that was due to him for a whole fortnight.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02918" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was a heavy, melancholy day. Soon
            after the second breakfast, Edmund bade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his horse
            for Peterborough, and then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but
            remembrances, which she had nobody to share in. She talked to her aunt Bertram— she must
            talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen so little of what had passed, and
            had so little curiosity, that it was heavy work. Lady Bertram was not certain of
            anybody's dress or anybody's place at supper but her own. </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_02919" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"She could not recollect what it
              was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was that Lady
              Prescott had noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been
              talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the
              room— somebody had whispered something to her; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what
              it could be."</span>
            <span id="said_no_02920" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">And these were her longest speeches
              and clearest communications: the rest was only a languid </span>
            <span id="said_no_02921" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Yes, yes; very well; did you? did
              he? I did not see <em>that</em>; I should not know one from the
              other."</span>
          
          <span id="said_no_02922" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was very bad. It was only better
            than Mrs. Norris's sharp answers would have been; but she being gone home with all the
            supernumerary jellies to nurse a sick maid, there was peace and good-humour in their
            little party, though it could not boast much beside.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02925" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">said Lady Bertram, when the

              sitting up so late last night. Fanny, you must do something to keep me awake. I cannot
              work. Fetch the cards; I feel so very stupid."</span>

          <span id="said_no_02927" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The cards were brought, and Fanny
            played at cribbage with her aunt till bedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself,
            no sounds were heard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the
            game— </span>
          <span id="said_no_02928" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"And <em>that</em>
            makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib. You are to deal, ma'am; shall I deal
            for you?"</span>
          <span id="said_no_02929" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny thought and thought again

            the difference which
            twenty-four hours had made in that room, and all that part of the house. Last night it
            had been hope and smiles, bustle and motion, noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room,
            and out of the drawing-room, and everywhere. Now it was languor, and all but
            solitude.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02931" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">A good night's rest improved her
            spirits. She could think of William the next day more cheerfully; and as the morning
            afforded her an opportunity of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss
            Crawford, in a very handsome style, with all the heightenings of imagination, and all
            the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a departed ball, she
            could afterwards bring her mind without much effort into its everyday state, and easily
            conform to the tranquillity of the present quiet week.</span>

            They were indeed a
            smaller party than she had ever known there for a whole day together, and <em>he</em> was gone on whom the comfort and cheerfulness of every family
            meeting and every meal chiefly depended. But this must be learned to be endured. He
            would soon be always gone; and she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room
            with her uncle, hear his voice, receive his questions, and even answer them, without
            such wretched feelings as she had formerly known.</span>

              both the first and second day, as they formed their very reduced circle after dinner;
              and in consideration of Fanny's swimming eyes, nothing more was said on the first day
              than to drink their good health; but on the second it led to something farther.
              William was kindly commended and his promotion hoped for.</span>

            good-nature she would not have prevented it, was lamenting the change it made in the
            prospect of Julia's return, which would otherwise have taken place about this time. A
            great deal of good sense followed on Sir Thomas's side, tending to reconcile his wife to
            the arrangement. Everything that a considerate parent <em>ought</em> to
            feel was advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate mother <em>must</em> feel in promoting her children's enjoyment was attributed to
            her nature. Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm </span>

            glanced at his niece, and then gravely replied, </span>

            not very likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who should invite her? Maria might be very glad to
            see her at Sotherton now and then, but she would not think of asking her to live there;
            and I am sure she is better off here; and besides, I cannot do without her."</span>

          <span id="said_no_02956" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The week which passed so quietly and
            peaceably at the great house in Mansfield had a very different character at the
            Parsonage. To the young lady, at least, in each family, it brought very different
            feelings. What was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation to
            Mary. Something arose from difference of disposition and habit: one so easily satisfied,
            the other so unused to endure; but still more might be imputed to difference of
            circumstances. In some points of interest they were exactly opposed to each other. To
            Fanny's mind, Edmund's absence was really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief. To
            Mary it was every way painful. She felt the want of his society every day, almost every
            hour, and was too much in want of it to derive anything but irritation from considering
            the object for which he went. He could not have devised anything more likely to raise
            his consequence than this week's absence, occurring as it did at the very time of her
            brother's going away, of William Price's going too, and completing the sort of general
            break-up of a party which had been so animated. She felt it keenly.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02957" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_mary" data-placement="auto top">
            They were now a miserable
            trio, confined within doors by a series of rain and snow, with nothing to do and no
            variety to hope for.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02958" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Angry as she was with Edmund for
            adhering to his own notions, and acting on them in defiance of her (and she had been so
            angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball), she could not help thinking of
            him continually when absent, dwelling on his merit and affection, and longing again for
            the almost daily meetings they lately had.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02959" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_mary" data-placement="auto top">
            His absence was
            unnecessarily long. He should not have planned such an absence —he should not have left
            home for a week, when her own departure from Mansfield was so near.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02960" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Then she began to blame
            herself.</span>

            She wished she had not
            spoken so warmly in their last conversation. She was afraid she had used some strong,
            some contemptuous expressions in speaking of the clergy, and that should not have been.
            It was ill-bred; it was wrong. She wished such words unsaid with all her heart.</span>

            week. All this was bad, but she had still more to feel when Friday came round again and
            brought no Edmund; when Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slight
            communication with the other family which Sunday produced, she learned that</span>

            before— if she had been sorry for what she said, and feared its too strong effect on
            him— she now felt and feared it all tenfold more. She had, moreover, to contend with one
            disagreeable emotion entirely new to her— jealousy.</span>

            His friend Mr. Owen had

            a time when, according to all preceding plans, she was to remove to London, meant

            Had Henry returned, as he
            talked of doing, at the end of three or four days, she should now have been leaving

          <span id="said_no_02968" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">It became absolutely necessary for her
            to get to Fanny and try to learn something more. She could not live any longer in such
            solitary wretchedness; and she made her way to the Park, through difficulties of walking
            which she had deemed unconquerable a week before, for the chance of hearing a little in
            addition, for the sake of at least hearing his name.</span>

            Fanny and Lady Bertram were together, and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope

            help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London, as will now
            undoubtedly be the case. I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he comes there
            will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to have seen him once more, I
            confess. But you must give my compliments to him. Yes; I think it must be compliments.
            Is not there a something wanted, Miss Price, in our language— a something between
            compliments and —and love— to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had
            together? So many months' acquaintance! But compliments may be sufficient here. Was his
            letter a long one? Does he give you much account of what he is doing? Is it Christmas
            gaieties that he is staying for?"</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02977" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"I only heard a part of the letter;
            it was to my uncle; but I believe it was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few
            lines. All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer, and that he
            had agreed to do so. A <em>few</em> days longer, or <em>some</em> days longer; I am not quite sure which."</span>

            thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you. But if he wrote to his father, no
            wonder he was concise. Who could write chat to Sir Thomas? If he had written to you,
            there would have been more particulars. You would have heard of balls and parties. He
            would have sent you a description of everything and everybody. How many Miss Owens are
            there?"</span>

              is sure to ask about another. But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young
              ladies— about any three sisters just grown up; for one knows, without being told,
              exactly what they are: all very accomplished and pleasing, and one very pretty. There
              is a beauty in every family; it is a regular thing. Two play on the pianoforte, and
              one on the harp; and all sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the
              better for not being taught; or something like it."</span>

            those one has never seen? Well, when your cousin comes back, he will find Mansfield very
            quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself. I do not like the idea
            of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near. She does not like my going."</span>

            missed when it is taken away; that is, there is a great difference felt. But I am not

              Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey; how should you like it? Stranger things have
              happened. I dare say they are trying for it. And they are quite in the light, for it
              would be a very pretty establishment for them. I do not at all wonder or blame them.
              It is everybody's duty to do as well for themselves as they can. Sir Thomas Bertram's
              son is somebody; and now he is in their own line. Their father is a clergyman, and
              their brother is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen together. He is their lawful
              property; he fairly belongs to them. You don't speak, Fanny; Miss Price, you don't
              speak. But honestly now, do not you rather expect it than otherwise?"</span>
