          <span id="said_no_02362" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The intercourse of the two families
            was at this period more nearly restored to what it had been in the autumn, than any
            member of the old intimacy had thought ever likely to be again. The return of Henry
            Crawford, and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it, but much was still
            owing to Sir Thomas's more than toleration of the neighbourly attempts at the Parsonage.
            His mind, now disengaged from the cares which had pressed on him at first, was at
            leisure to find the Grants and their young inmates really worth visiting; and though
            infinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous matrimonial
            establishment that could be among the apparent possibilities of any one most dear to
            him, and disdaining even as a littleness the being quick-sighted on such points,</span>
          <span id="said_no_02363" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he could not avoid perceiving,</span>
          <span id="said_no_02364" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">in a grand and careless way,</span>

            Mr. Crawford was somewhat
            distinguishing his nieceâ€”</span>
          <span id="said_no_02367" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">nor perhaps refrain (though

          <span id="said_no_02368" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">His readiness, however, in agreeing to
            dine at the Parsonage, when the general invitation was at last hazarded, after many
            debates and many doubts as to whether it were worth while, "because Sir Thomas seemed so
            ill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!" proceeded from good-breeding and
            goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr. Crawford, but as being one in an
            agreeable group: for it was in the course of that very visit that</span>
          <span id="said_no_02369" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he first began to think that</span>

            pleasant one, being composed in a good proportion of those who would talk and those who
            would listen; and the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful, according to the usual
            style of the Grants, and too much according to the usual habits of all to raise any
            emotion except in</span>

            complying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are, speculation was
            decided on almost as soon as whist; and Lady Bertram soon found herself in the critical
            situation of being applied to for her own choice between the games, and being required
            either to draw a card for whist or not. She hesitated. Luckily Sir Thomas was at
            hand.</span>

            Mrs. Norris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual
            state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss Crawford's direction, were arranged
            round the other. It was a fine arrangement for Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny,
            and with his hands full of business, having two persons' cards to manage as well as his
            own; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of the rules of
            the game in three minutes, he had yet to inspirit her play, sharpen her avarice, and
            harden her heart, which, especially in any competition with William, was a work of some
            difficulty; and as for Lady Bertram, he must continue in charge of all her fame and
            fortune through the whole evening; and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her
            cards when the deal began, must direct her in whatever was to be done with them to the
            end of it.</span>

            everything with happy ease, and preeminent in all the lively turns, quick resources, and
            playful impudence that could do honour to the game; and the round table was altogether a
            very comfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and orderly silence of the
            other.</span>

            enjoyment and success of his lady, but in vain; no pause was long enough for the time
            his measured manner needed; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant
            was able, at the end of the first rubber, to go to her and pay her compliments.</span>

              They had been hunting
              together, and were in the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield,
              when his horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had been obliged to
              give up, and make the best of his way back.</span>

              passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees, because I can never bear to ask; but I
              have not told you that, with my usual luckâ€” for I never do wrong without gaining by it
              â€”I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was
              suddenly, upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the midst of a retired
              little village between gently rising hills; a small stream before me to be forded, a
              church standing on a sort of knoll to my rightâ€” which church was strikingly large and
              handsome for the place, and not a gentleman or half a gentleman's house to be seen
              excepting one â€”to be presumed the Parsonage â€”within a stone's throw of the said knoll

          <span id="said_no_02427" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"No, no, not so bad as that. The
            farmyard must be moved, I grant you; but I am not aware of anything else. The house is
            by no means bad, and when the yard is removed, there may be a very tolerable approach to
            it."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02428" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"The farmyard must be cleared away
            entirely, and planted up to shut out the blacksmith's shop. The house must be turned to
            front the east instead of the northâ€” the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be
            on that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may be done. And <em>there</em> must be your approach, through what is at present the garden.
            You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house; which will be giving it
            the best aspect in the world, sloping to the south-east. The ground seems precisely
            formed for it. I rode fifty yards up the lane, between the church and the house, in
            order to look about me; and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The meadows
            beyond what <em>will</em>
            <em>be</em> the garden, as well as what now <em>is</em>,
            sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to the principal
            road through the village, must be all laid together, of course; very pretty meadows they
            are, finely sprinkled with timber. They belong to the living, I suppose; if not, you
            must purchase them. Then the streamâ€” something must be done with the stream; but I could
            not quite determine what. I had two or three ideas."</span>

              capable of. (Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie
              just before you.) The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving it the air of a
              gentleman's residence. <em>That</em> will be done by the removal of the
              farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never saw a house of the kind
              which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman's residence, so much the look of a
              something above a mere parsonage-houseâ€” above the expenditure of a few hundreds a
              year. It is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as
              windows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse: it is a
              solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as one might suppose a respectable old
              country family had lived in from generation to generation, through two centuries at
              least, and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in."</span>

              dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen. She will have
              nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By some such improvements as I have suggested (I
              do not really require you to proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt
              anybody's striking out a better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it
              into a <em>place</em>. From being the mere gentleman's residence, it
              becomes, by judicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste, modern
              manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and that house receive such
              an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every
              creature travelling the road; especially as there is no real squire's house to dispute

              house nominally inhabited, and go through divine service; he might be the clergyman of
              Thornton Lacey every seventh day, for three or four hours, if that would content him.

            listening to what his nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing which had
