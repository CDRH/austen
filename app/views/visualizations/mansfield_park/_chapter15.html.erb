            readily; and soon after Miss Bertram's return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth arrived,
            and another character was consequently cast. He had the offer of Count Cassel and
            Anhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse, and wanted Miss Bertram to direct him;
            but upon being made to understand the different style of the characters, and which was
            which, and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London, and had thought

            a very stupid

          <span id="said_no_01382" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he soon decided for the Count. Miss
            Bertram approved the decision, for the less he had to learn the better; and though she
            could not sympathise in his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act together, nor
            wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over the leaves with the hope of still
            discovering such a scene, she very kindly took his part in hand, and curtailed every
            speech that admitted being shortened; besides</span>

          <span id="said_no_01385" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and chusing his colours. Mr. Rushworth
            liked the idea of his finery very well, though affecting to despise it; and was too much
            engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others, or draw any of
            those conclusions, or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared
            for.</span>

          <span id="said_no_01386" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Thus much was settled before Edmund,
            who had been out all the morning, knew anything of the matter; but when he entered the
            drawing-room before dinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and Mr.
            Yates; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable
            news.</span>

              to be Count Cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak,
              and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of a shooting-dress. I do
              not know how I shall like it."</span>

            heart beat for him as she heard this speech, and saw his look, and felt what his

            was his only reply to Mr. Rushworth, and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if

              difficulties, we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing
              so unexceptionable, as Lovers' Vows. The wonder is that it should not have been
              thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we have all the advantage of
              what I saw at Ecclesford; and it is so useful to have anything of a model! We have
              cast almost every part."</span>

            fire, where sat his mother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great

          <span id="said_no_01405" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Rushworth" data-placement="auto top">"I come in three times, and have
            two-and-forty speeches. That's something, is not it? But I do not much like the idea of
            being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin
            cloak."</span>

          <span id="said_no_01406" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edmund could not answer him. In a few
            minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter;
            and being accompanied by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth,
            Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying, </span>
          <span id="said_no_01407" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I cannot, before Mr. Yates, speak what
            I feel as to this play, without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford; but I must now,
            my dear Maria, tell <em>you</em>, that I think it exceedingly unfit for
            private representation, and that I hope you will give it up. I cannot but suppose you
              <em>will</em> when you have read it carefully over. Read only the first
            act aloud to either your mother or aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be
            necessary to send you to your <em>father's</em> judgment, I am
            convinced."</span>

            <span id="said_no_01410" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I am perfectly acquainted with the
              play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions, and so forth, which will be made,
              of course, I can see nothing objectionable in it; and <em>I</em> am not
              the <em>only</em> young woman you find who thinks it very fit for
              private representation."</span>

            <span id="said_no_01413" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"but in this matter it is <em>you</em> who are to lead. <em>You</em> must set the
              example. If others have blundered, it is your place to put them right, and shew them
              what true delicacy is. In all points of decorum <em>your</em> conduct
              must be law to the rest of the party."</span>

            some effect, for no one loved better to lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour
            she answered,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01415" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I am much obliged to you, Edmund;
            you mean very well, I am sure: but I still think you see things too strongly; and I
            really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind. <em>There</em> would be the greatest indecorum, I think."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01416" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Do you imagine that I could have such
            an idea in my head? No; let your conduct be the only harangue. Say that, on examining
            the part, you feel yourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion and
            confidence than you can be supposed to have. Say this with firmness, and it will be
            quite enough. All who can distinguish will understand your motive. The play will be
            given up, and your delicacy honoured as it ought."</span>

            between us— the difference in our situations —that <em>she</em> need not
            be so scrupulous as <em>I</em> might feel necessary. I am sure she would
            argue so. No; you must excuse me; I cannot retract my consent; it is too far settled,
            everybody would be so disappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very
            nice, we shall never act anything."</span>

            <span id="said_no_01433" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"If every play is to be objected to,
              you will act nothing, and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away, and
              I am sure <em>that</em> would be a discredit to us all. I do not know
              the play; but, as Maria says, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so
              with most of them) it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise, Edmund. As
              Mr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only wish Tom had known his own
              mind when the carpenters began, for there was the loss of half a day's work about
              those side-doors. The curtain will be a good job, however. The maids do their work
              very well, and I think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings. There
              is no occasion to put them so very close together. I <em>am</em> of some
              use, I hope, in preventing waste and making the most of things. There should always be
              one steady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot to tell Tom of something
              that happened to me this very day. I had been looking about me in the poultry-yard,
              and was just coming out, when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the
              servants' hall-door with two bits of deal board in his hand, bringing them to father,
              you may be sure; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father, and then
              father had bid him bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no how do without
              them. I knew what all this meant, for the servants' dinner-bell was ringing at the
              very moment over our heads; and as I hate such encroaching people (the Jacksons are
              very encroaching, I have always said so: just the sort of people to get all they can),
              I said to the boy directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know, who
              ought to be ashamed of himself), '<em>I'll</em> take the boards to your
              father, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can.' The boy looked very silly,
              and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I might speak pretty sharp; and
              I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while. I hate
              such greediness— so good as your father is to the family, employing the man all the
              year round!"</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01434" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Nobody was at the trouble of an
            answer; the others soon returned; and Edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them
            right must be his only satisfaction.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01435" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Dinner passed heavily. Mrs. Norris
            related again her triumph over Dick Jackson, but neither play nor preparation were
            otherwise much talked of, for Edmund's disapprobation was felt even by his brother,
            though he would not have owned it. Maria, wanting Henry Crawford's animating support,
            thought the subject better avoided. Mr. Yates, who was trying to make himself agreeable
            to Julia, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her
            secession from their company; and Mr. Rushworth, having only his own part and his own
            dress in his head, had soon talked away all that could be said of either.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01436" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">But the concerns of the theatre were
            suspended only for an hour or two: there was still a great deal to be settled; and the
            spirits of evening giving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their
            being reassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a separate
            table, with the play open before them, and were just getting deep in the subject when a
            most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late
            and dark and dirty as it was, could not help coming, and were received with the most
            grateful joy.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01437" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">"Well, how do you go on?" and "What
            have you settled?" and "Oh! we can do nothing without you," followed the first
            salutations; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table, while
            his sister made her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention was complimenting
