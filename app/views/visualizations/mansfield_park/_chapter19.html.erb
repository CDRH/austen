            to be described? To the greater number it was a moment of absolute horror.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01742" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_mpsoc" data-placement="auto top">
            Sir Thomas in the
            house!</span>
          <span id="said_no_01743" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">All felt the instantaneous conviction.
            Not a hope of imposition or mistake was harboured anywhere. Julia's looks were an
            evidence of the fact that made it indisputable; and after the first starts and
            exclamations, not a word was spoken for half a minute: each with an altered countenance
            was looking at some other, and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most unwelcome,
            most ill-timed, most appalling!</span>
          <span id="said_no_01744" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Yates might consider</span>
          <span id="said_no_01745" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_yates" data-placement="auto top">
            it only as a vexatious
            interruption for the evening,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01746" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a
            blessing; but every other heart was sinking under some degree of self-condemnation or
            undefined alarm, every other heart was suggesting,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01747" class="said certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mansfield Park society" data-placement="auto top">
            "What will become of us? what
            is to be done now?"</span>
          <span id="said_no_01748" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was a terrible pause; and terrible
            to every ear were the corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing
            footsteps.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01749" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Julia was the first to move and speak
            again. Jealousy and bitterness had been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common
            cause; but at the moment of her appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of
            devotion to Agatha's narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart; and as soon as she
            could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock of her words, he still kept his
            station and retained her sister's hand, her wounded heart swelled again with injury, and
            looking as red as she had been white before, she turned out of the room, saying,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01750" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Julia Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"<em>I</em> need not be
            afraid of appearing before him."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01751" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her going roused the rest; and at the
            same moment the two brothers stepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something.
            A very few words between them were sufficient. The case admitted no difference of
            opinion: they must go to the drawing-room directly. Maria joined them with the same
            intent, just then the stoutest of the three; for the very circumstance which had driven
            Julia away was to her the sweetest support.Henry Crawford's retaining her hand at such a
            moment, a moment of such peculiar proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt and
            anxiety.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01752" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She hailed</span>
          <span id="said_no_01753" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">it as</span>
          <span id="said_no_01754" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_maria" data-placement="auto top">
            an earnest of the most
            serious determination,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01755" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and was equal even to encounter her
            father. They walked off, utterly heedless of Mr. Rushworth's repeated question
            of,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01756" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Rushworth" data-placement="auto top">"Shall I go too? Had not I better go
            too? Will not it be right for me to go too?"</span>
          <span id="said_no_01757" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">but they were no sooner through the
            door than</span>
          <span id="said_no_01758" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> Henry Crawford</span>
          <span id="said_no_01759" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> undertook to answer the anxious
            inquiry, and,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01760" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">encouraging him</span>

            respects to Sir Thomas without delay,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01762" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">sent him after the others with
            delighted haste.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01763" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny was left with only the Crawfords
            and Mr. Yates. She had been quite overlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of
            her claims on Sir Thomas's affection was much too humble to give her any idea of
            classing herself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and gain a little
            breathing-time. Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest, by
            the right of a disposition which not even innocence could keep from suffering. She was
            nearly fainting: all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it
            compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the development before him,
            with solicitude on Edmund's account indescribable. She had found a seat, where in
            excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts, while the other three,
            no longer under any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of vexation,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01764" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">lamenting over</span>

            such an unlooked-for
            premature arrival as a most untoward event,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01766" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and without mercy</span>

            Sir Thomas had been
            twice as long on his passage, or were still in Antigua.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01770" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Crawfords were more warm on the
            subject than Mr. Yates, from better understanding the family, and judging more clearly
            of the mischief that must ensue. The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt
            the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while</span>
          <span id="said_no_01771" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Yates</span>
          <span id="said_no_01772" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">considered it only as a temporary
            interruption, a disaster for the evening, and</span>
          <span id="said_no_01773" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">could even suggest</span>

             the possibility of the
            rehearsal being renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over,
            and he might be at leisure to be amused by it.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01775" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Crawfords</span>
          <span id="said_no_01776" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">laughed at the idea; and having soon
            agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly home and leaving the family to
            themselves,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01777" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">proposed</span>

            Mr. Yates's
            accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01779" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">But Mr. Yates, having never been with
            those who thought much of parental claims, or family confidence, could not perceive that
            anything of the kind was necessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, </span>
          <span id="said_no_01780" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Yates" data-placement="auto top">"he preferred remaining where he was,
            that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he <em>was</em> come; and besides, he did not think it would be fair by the
            others to have everybody run away."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01781" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny was just beginning to collect
            herself, and to feel that if she staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when
            this point was settled, and being commissioned with the brother and sister's apology,
            saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the dreadful duty of
            appearing before her uncle.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01782" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Too soon did she find herself at the
            drawing-room door; and after pausing a moment for what she knew would not come, for a
            courage which the outside of no door had ever supplied to her, she turned the lock in
            desperation, and the lights of the drawing-room, and all the collected family, were
            before her. As she entered, her own name caught her ear.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01783" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas</span>
          <span id="said_no_01784" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">was at that moment looking round him,
            and saying, </span>
          <span id="said_no_01785" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sir Thomas Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"But where is Fanny? Why do not I see
            my little Fanny?"—</span>
          <span id="said_no_01786" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> and on perceiving her, came forward
            with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01787" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">calling her</span>
          <span id="said_no_01788" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_9" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            his dear Fanny,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01789" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">kissing her affectionately, and
            observing with decided pleasure</span>
          <span id="said_no_01790" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_9" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            how much she was
            grown!</span>
          <span id="said_no_01791" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny knew not how to feel, nor where
            to look. She was quite oppressed.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01792" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            He had never been so
            kind, so <em>very</em> kind to her in his life. His manner seemed changed,
            his voice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that had been awful in his
            dignity seemed lost in tenderness.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01793" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He led her nearer the light and looked
            at her again— inquired particularly after her health, and then, correcting
            himself,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01794" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">observed that</span>
          <span id="said_no_01795" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_9" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            he need not inquire, for
            her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01796" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">A fine blush having succeeded the
            previous paleness of her face, he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement
            in health and beauty. He inquired next after her family, especially William: and his
            kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and
            thinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift her eyes to his
            face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the burnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue
            and a hot climate, every tender feeling was increased, and she was miserable in
            considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01797" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the
            party, who at his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire. He had the best right
            to be the talker; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house, in
            the centre of his family, after such a separation, made him communicative and chatty in
            a very unusual degree; and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage, and
            answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01798" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            His business in Antigua
            had latterly been prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool, having had an
            opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel, instead of waiting for
            the packet;</span>
          <span id="said_no_01799" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and all the little particulars of his
            proceedings and events, his arrivals and departures, were most promptly delivered, as he
            sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him
            —interrupting himself more than once, however,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01800" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">to remark on</span>

            his good fortune in
            finding them all at home— coming unexpectedly as he did— all collected together exactly
            as he could have wished, but dared not depend on.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01802" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Rushworth was not forgotten: a
            most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shaking had already met him, and with pointed
            attention he was now included in the objects most intimately connected with Mansfield.
            There was nothing disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth's appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking
            him already.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01803" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">By not one of the circle was he
            listened to with such unbroken, unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife, who was really
            extremely happy to see him, and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as
            to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years. She had been
              <em>almost</em> fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained so
            sensibly animated as to put away her work, move Pug from her side, and give all her
            attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband. She had no anxieties for anybody
            to cloud <em>her</em> pleasure: her own time had been irreproachably spent
            during his absence: she had done a great deal of carpet-work, and made many yards of
            fringe; and she would have answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits
            of all the young people as for her own. It was so agreeable to her to see him again, and
            hear him talk, to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his
            narratives,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01804" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">that she began particularly to

          <span id="said_no_01805" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ladyb" data-placement="auto top">
            how dreadfully she must
            have missed him, and how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened
            absence.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01806" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Norris was by no means to be
            compared in happiness to her sister. Not that <em>she</em> was incommoded
            by many fears of Sir Thomas's disapprobation when the present state of his house should
            be known, for her judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive caution
            with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth's pink satin cloak as her brother-in-law
            entered, she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm; but she was vexed by the
              <em>manner</em> of his return. It had left her nothing to do. Instead of
            being sent for out of the room, and seeing him first, and having to spread the happy
            news through the house, Sir Thomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the
            nerves of his wife and children, had sought no confidant but the butler, and had been

            defrauded of an office on which she had always depended, whether his arrival or his
            death were to be the thing unfolded; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having
            anything to bustle about, and labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but
            tranquillity and silence. Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat, she might have gone to
            the housekeeper with troublesome directions, and insulted the footmen with injunctions
            of despatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner: he would take nothing,
            nothing till tea came—</span>

            just in time to witness the first meeting of his father and his friend. Sir Thomas had
            been a good deal surprised to find candles burning in his room; and on casting his eye
            round it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air of confusion in
            the furniture. The removal of the bookcase from before the billiard-room door struck him
            especially, but he had scarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this, before
            there were sounds from the billiard-room to astonish him still farther.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01839" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            Some one was talking
            there in a very loud accent; he did not know the voice —more than talking— almost
            hallooing.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01840" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He stepped to the door, rejoicing at
            that moment in having the means of immediate communication, and, opening it, found
            himself on the stage of a theatre, and opposed to a ranting young man, who appeared
            likely to knock him down backwards. At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir Thomas,
            and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the whole course of his
            rehearsals, Tom Bertram entered at the other end of the room; and never had he found
            greater difficulty in keeping his countenance. His father's looks of solemnity and
            amazement on this his first appearance on any stage, and the gradual metamorphosis of
            the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates, making his bow
            and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such an exhibition, such a piece of true acting,
            as he would not have lost upon any account.</span>

            the indulgence of any images of merriment. It was necessary for him to step forward,
            too, and assist the introduction, and with many awkward sensations he did his best. Sir
            Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which was due to his own
            character, but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of the acquaintance as
            with the manner of its commencement. Mr. Yates's family and connexions were sufficiently
            known to him to render his introduction as the "particular friend," another of the
            hundred particular friends of his son, exceedingly unwelcome; and it needed all the
            felicity of being again at home, and all the forbearance it could supply, to save Sir
            Thomas from anger on finding himself thus bewildered in his own house,</span>

            the most at home of the two.</span>

            and heartily wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them but partial
            expression, began to see, more clearly than he had ever done before, that there might be
            some ground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave
            towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that when he inquired with mild gravity
            after the fate of the billiard-table, he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable
            curiosity. A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side;
            and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation
            in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates, as to the happiness of the arrangement, the
            three gentlemen returned to the drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of
            gravity which was not lost on all.</span>

              a character. It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by candlelight,
              and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit."</span>
          
          <span id="said_no_01852" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> And then he would have changed the
            subject, and sipped his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer hue; but Mr.
            Yates, without discernment to catch Sir Thomas's meaning, or diffidence, or delicacy, or
            discretion enough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others
            with the least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him on the topic of the theatre, would
            torment him with questions and remarks relative to it, and finally would make him hear
            the whole history of his disappointment at Ecclesford. Sir Thomas listened most
            politely, but found much to offend his ideas of decorum, and confirm his ill-opinion of
            Mr. Yates's habits of thinking, from the beginning to the end of the story; and when it
            was over, could give him no other assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow
            conveyed.</span>

            friend as soon as possible, and immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had
            done and were doing: told him of the gradual increase of their views, the happy
            conclusion of their first difficulties, and present promising state of affairs; relating
            everything with so blind an interest as made him not only totally unconscious of the
            uneasy movements of many of his friends as they sat, the change of countenance, the
            fidget, the hem! of unquietness, but prevented him even from seeing the expression of
            the face on which his own eyes were fixed— from seeing Sir Thomas's dark brow contract
            as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters and Edmund, dwelling
            particularly on the latter, and speaking a language, a remonstrance, a reproof, which
              <em>he</em> felt at his heart. Not less acutely was it felt by Fanny,
            who had edged back her chair behind her aunt's end of the sofa, and, screened from
            notice herself, saw all that was passing before her. Such a look of reproach at Edmund
            from his father she could never have expected to witness; and to feel that it was in any

              indulgent."</span>
            <span id="said_no_01867" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Then turning away towards any or all
              of the rest, he tranquilly said, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01868" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sir Thomas Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Mr. and Miss Crawford were
              mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeable
              acquaintance?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01869" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Tom was the only one at all ready with
            an answer, but he being entirely without particular regard for either, without jealousy
            either in love or acting, could speak very handsomely of both.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01870" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Tom Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant,
            gentleman-like man; his sister a sweet, pretty, elegant, lively girl."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01871" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Rushworth could be silent no
            longer.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01872" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Rushworth" data-placement="auto top">"I do not say he is not
            gentleman-like, considering; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet
            eight, or he will be expecting a well-looking man."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01873" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas did not quite understand
            this, and looked with some surprise at the speaker.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01874" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Rushworth" data-placement="auto top">"If I must say what I think,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_01875" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> continued Mr. Rushworth, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01876" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Rushworth" data-placement="auto top">"in my opinion it is very
              disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much of a good thing. I am not
              so fond of acting as I was at first. I think we are a great deal better employed,
              sitting comfortably here among ourselves, and doing nothing."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01877" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas looked again, and then
            replied with an approving smile, </span>
          <span id="said_no_01878" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sir Thomas Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I am happy to find our sentiments on
            this subject so much the same. It gives me sincere satisfaction. That I should be
            cautious and quick-sighted, and feel many scruples which my children do <em>not</em> feel, is perfectly natural; and equally so that my value for
            domestic tranquillity, for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much exceed
            theirs. But at your time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable circumstance for
            yourself, and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible of the importance of
            having an ally of such weight."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01879" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr.
            Rushworth's opinion in better words than he could find himself. He was aware that he
            must not expect a genius in Mr. Rushworth; but as a well-judging, steady young man, with
            better notions than his elocution would do justice to, he intended to value him very
            highly. It was impossible for many of the others not to smile. Mr. Rushworth hardly knew
            what to do with so much meaning; but by looking, as he really felt, most exceedingly
            pleased with Sir Thomas's good opinion, and saying scarcely anything, he did his best
            towards preserving that good opinion a little longer.</span>
