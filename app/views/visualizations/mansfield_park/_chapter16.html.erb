        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01552" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was not in Miss Crawford's power to
            talk Fanny into any real forgetfulness of what had passed. When the evening was over,
            she went to bed full of it, her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack
            from her cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in, and her spirits sinking under her
            aunt's unkind reflection and reproach. To be called into notice in such a manner, to
            hear that it was but the prelude to something so infinitely worse, to be told that she
            must do what was so impossible as to act; and then to have the charge of obstinacy and
            ingratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the dependence of her situation, had
            been too distressing at the time to make the remembrance when she was alone much less
            so, especially with the superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in
            continuation of the subject.</span>

            Miss Crawford had
            protected her only for the time; and if she were applied to again among themselves with
            all the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund perhaps
            away, what should she do?</span>
          <span id="said_no_01554" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She fell asleep before she could
            answer the question, and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the next morning. The
            little white attic, which had continued her sleeping-room ever since her first entering
            the family, proving incompetent to suggest any reply, she had recourse, as soon as she
            was dressed, to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking about in and
            thinking, and of which she had now for some time been almost equally mistress. It had
            been their school-room; so called till the Miss Bertrams would not allow it to be called
            so any longer, and inhabited as such to a later period. There Miss Lee had lived, and
            there they had read and written, and talked and laughed, till within the last three
            years, when she had quitted them. The room had then become useless, and for some time
            was quite deserted, except by Fanny, when she visited her plants, or wanted one of the
            books, which she was still glad to keep there, from the deficiency of space and
            accommodation in her little chamber above: but gradually, as her value for the comforts
            of it increased, she had added to her possessions, and spent more of her time there; and
            having nothing to oppose her, had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it,
            that it was now generally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it had been called ever
            since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny's, almost as decidedly as the
            white attic: the smallness of the one making the use of the other so evidently
            reasonable that the Miss Bertrams, with every superiority in their own apartments which
            their own sense of superiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs.
            Norris, having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny's account, was
            tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody else wanted, though the terms in
            which she sometimes spoke of the indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in
            the house.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01555" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The aspect was so favourable that even
            without a fire it was habitable in many an early spring and late autumn morning to such
            a willing mind as Fanny's; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be
            driven from it entirely, even when winter came. The comfort of it in her hours of
            leisure was extreme. She could go there after anything unpleasant below, and find
            immediate consolation in some pursuit, or some train of thought at hand. Her plants, her
            books —of which she had been a collector from the first hour of her commanding a
            shilling —her writing-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within her
            reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would do, she could
            scarcely see an object in that room which had not an interesting remembrance connected
            with it.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01556" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            Everything was a friend,
            or bore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much of suffering
            to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood, her feelings disregarded, and
            her comprehension undervalued; though she had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule,
            and neglect, yet almost every recurrence of either had led to something
            consolatory:</span>
          <span id="said_no_01557" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            her aunt Bertram had
            spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what was yet more frequent or more
            dear, Edmund had been her champion and her friend: he had supported her cause or
            explained her meaning, he had told her not to cry, or had given her some proof of
            affection which made her tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together, so
            harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01558" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The room was most dear to her, and she
            would not have changed its furniture for the handsomest in the house, though what had
            been originally plain had suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its greatest
            elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia's work, too ill done for the
            drawing-room, three transparencies, made in a rage for transparencies, for the three
            lower panes of one window, where Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy
            and a moonlight lake in Cumberland, a collection of family profiles, thought unworthy of
            being anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their side, and pinned against the
            wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William,
            with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom, in letters as tall as the mainmast.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01559" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">To this nest of comforts Fanny now
            walked down to try its influence on an agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking
            at Edmund's profile she could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her
            geraniums she might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. But she had more than
            fears of her own perseverance to remove: she had begun to feel undecided as to what she
              <em>ought</em>
            <em>to</em>
            <em>do</em>; and as she walked round the room her doubts were
            increasing.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01560" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
             Was she <em>right</em> in refusing what was so warmly asked, so strongly wished for—
            what might be so essential to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the
            greatest complaisance had set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness, and a
            fear of exposing herself? And would Edmund's judgment, would his persuasion of Sir
            Thomas's disapprobation of the whole, be enough to justify her in a determined denial in
            spite of all the rest?</span>
          <span id="said_no_01561" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> It would be so horrible to her to act
            that she was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of her own scruples; and as she
            looked around her, the claims of her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the
            sight of present upon present that she had received from them. The table between the
            windows was covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which had been given her at
            different times, principally by Tom; and she grew bewildered as to the amount of the
            debt which all these kind remembrances produced. A tap at the door roused her in the
            midst of this attempt to find her way to her duty, and her gentle </span>
          <span id="said_no_01562" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"Come in"</span>

            before whom all her doubts were wont to be laid. Her eyes brightened at the sight of
            Edmund.</span>

          <span id="said_no_01564" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few

            compliment, highly as it gratified her.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01570" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Yes, your advice and opinion. I do not
            know what to do. This acting scheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen
            almost as bad a play as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask
            the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the end of all the
            privacy and propriety which was talked about at first. I know no harm of Charles Maddox;
            but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this
            manner is highly objectionable, the <em>more</em> than intimacy— the
            familiarity. I cannot think of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of
            such magnitude as must, <em>if</em>
            <em>possible</em>, be prevented. Do not you see it in the same
            light?"</span>

              but I can think of no other alternative. Can you, Fanny?"</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01580" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"But what? I see your judgment is not
            with me. Think it a little over. Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the
            mischief that <em>may</em>, of the unpleasantness that <em>must</em> arise from a young man's being received in this manner: domesticated among
            us; authorised to come at all hours, and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away
            all restraints. To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create.
            It is all very bad! Put yourself in Miss Crawford's place, Fanny. Consider what it would
            be to act Amelia with a stranger. She has a right to be felt for, because she evidently
            feels for herself. I heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her
            unwillingness to be acting with a stranger; and as she probably engaged in the part with
            different expectations— perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was
            likely to be— it would be ungenerous, it would be really wrong to expose her to it. Her
            feelings ought to be respected. Does it not strike you so, Fanny? You hesitate."</span>

            am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against, and what you are

            triumph when they see how infamously I act. But, however, triumph there certainly will
            be, and I must brave it. But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the
            business, of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall be well
            repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can do nothing: I have offended them, and
            they will not hear me; but when I have put them in good-humour by this concession, I am
            not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller
            circle than they are now in the high road for. This will be a material gain. My object
            is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants. Will not this be worth
