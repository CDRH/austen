            passed away, and Fanny was still thinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without
            interruption from any one. She began to be surprised at being left so long, and to
            listen with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices again. She
            listened, and at length she heard; she heard voices and feet approaching; but she had
            just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted, when Miss Bertram, Mr.
            Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued from the same path which she had trod herself, and
            were before her.</span>

          <span id="said_no_00956" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">were the first salutations. She told

            on each side, she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before, and discussed
            the possibility of improvements with much animation. Nothing was fixed on; but Henry
            Crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generally speaking, whatever he proposed
            was immediately approved, first by her, and then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal
            business seemed to be to hear the others, and who scarcely risked an original thought of
            his own beyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith's place.</span>

            It was the very thing of

            he had brought the key;

            <span id="said_no_00979" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">speaking rather lower,</span>

          <span id="said_no_00981" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">After a moment's embarrassment the

          <span id="said_no_00983" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"I am afraid I am not quite so much
            the man of the world as might be good for me in some points. My feelings are not quite

          <span id="said_no_00985" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"You seemed to enjoy your drive here
            very much this morning. I was glad to see you so well entertained. You and Julia were

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00986" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but
            I have not the least recollection at what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her some
            ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my uncle's. Your sister loves to
            laugh."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00987" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"You think her more light-hearted

            <span id="said_no_00988" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"More easily amused,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_00989" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> he replied;</span>
            <span id="said_no_00990" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"consequently, you know,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_00991" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">smiling,</span>

              hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles' drive."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_00994" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"You have, undoubtedly; and there are
            situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects,
            however, are too fair to justify want of spirits. You have a very smiling scene before
            you."</span>
        </p>
        <p><span id="said_no_00995" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Do you mean literally or
            figuratively? Literally, I conclude. Yes, certainly, the sun shines, and the park looks
            very cheerful. But unluckily that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint
            and hardship. 'I cannot get out,' as the starling said."</span>
          <span id="said_no_00996" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> As she spoke, and it was with
            expression, she walked to the gate: he followed her.</span>
          <span id="said_no_00997" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching
            this key!"</span>
          <span id="said_no_00998" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top"> "And for the world you would not get
            out without the key and without Mr. Rushworth's authority and protection, or I think you
            might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance;
            I think it might be done, if you really wished to be more at large, and could allow
            yourself to think it not prohibited." </span>
          <span id="said_no_00999" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Bertram" data-placement="auto top"> "Prohibited! nonsense! I certainly
            can get out that way, and I will. Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we
            shall not be out of sight." </span>
          <span id="said_no_01000" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top"> "Or if we are, Miss Price will be so
            good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the

          <span id="said_no_01001" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny, feeling all this to be wrong,
            could not help making an effort to prevent it. </span>

              against those spikes; you will tear your gown; you will be in danger of slipping into

            while these words were spoken, and, smiling with all the good-humour of success, she

          <span id="said_no_01007" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny was again left to her solitude,
            and with no increase of pleasant feelings, for she was sorry for almost all that she had
            seen and heard, astonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford. By taking a
            circuitous route, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonable direction to the knoll,
            they were soon beyond her eye; and for some minutes longer she remained without sight or
            sound of any companion. She seemed to have the little wood all to herself. She could
            almost have thought that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it, but that it was
            impossible for Edmund to forget her so entirely.</span>

          <span id="said_no_01008" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was again roused from disagreeable
            musings by sudden footsteps: somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal
            walk. She expected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath, and with
            a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, </span>
          <span id="said_no_01009" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Julia Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Heyday! Where are the others? I

            unhappy in having to communicate what had passed. He joined her within five minutes
            after Julia's exit; and though she made the best of the story, he was evidently
            mortified and displeased in no common degree. At first he scarcely said anything; his
            looks only expressed his extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked to the gate and
            stood there, without seeming to know what to do.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01056" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny's thoughts were now all
            engrossed by the two who had left her so long ago, and getting quite impatient, she
            resolved to go in search of them. She followed their steps along the bottom walk, and
            had just turned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford once more
            caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings brought them before her.
            They were just returned into the wilderness from the park, to which a sidegate, not
            fastened, had tempted them very soon after their leaving her, and they had been across a
            portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning
            to reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees. This was their
            history. It was evident that they had been spending their time pleasantly, and were not
            aware of the length of their absence.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01057" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny's best consolation was in being
            assured that</span>
          <span id="said_no_01058" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
             Edmund had wished for her

          <span id="said_no_01059" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>

            he should certainly have
            come back for her, had she not been tired already;</span>
          <span id="said_no_01062" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">but this was not quite sufficient to
            do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour, when he had talked of only a few
            minutes, nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know what they had been
            conversing about all that time; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment
            and depression, as they prepared by general agreement to return to the house.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01063" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">On reaching the bottom of the steps to
            the terrace, Mrs. Rushworth and Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready
            for the wilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the house. Mrs.
            Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatever cross-accidents had occurred
            to intercept the pleasures of her nieces, she had found a morning of complete enjoyment;
            for the housekeeper, after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had
            taken her to the dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the receipt for a
            famous cream cheese; and since Julia's leaving them they had been met by the gardener,
            with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance, for she had set him right as to
            his grandson's illness, convinced him that it was an ague, and promised him a charm for
            it; and he, in return, had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants, and actually
            presented her with a very curious specimen of heath.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01064" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">On this <em>rencontre</em> they all returned to the house together, there to lounge away the time
            as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, and Quarterly Reviews, till the return of the
            others, and the arrival of dinner. It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two
            gentlemen came in, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially
            agreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the object of the day.
            By their own accounts they had been all walking after each other, and the junction which
            had taken place at last seemed, to Fanny's observation, to have been as much too late
            for re-establishing harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any
            alteration. She felt, as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth, that hers was not the
            only dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was gloom on the face of each. Mr. Crawford
            and Miss Bertram were much more gay, and she thought that he was taking particular
            pains, during dinner, to do away any little resentment of the other two, and restore
            general good-humour.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01065" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Dinner was soon followed by tea and
            coffee, a ten miles' drive home allowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their
            sitting down to table, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came
            to the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained a few pheasants' eggs
            and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made abundance of civil speeches to Mrs.
            Rushworth, was ready to lead the way. At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching
            Julia, said,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01066" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"I hope I am not to lose my
            companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat."</span>
          <span id="said_no_01067" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The request had not been foreseen, but
            was very graciously received, and Julia's day was likely to end almost as well as it
            began. Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different, and was a little
            disappointed; but her conviction of being really the one preferred comforted her under
            it, and enabled her to receive Mr. Rushworth's parting attentions as she ought. He was
            certainly better pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending
            the box, and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.</span>

        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01068" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"Well, Fanny, this has been a fine
              day for you, upon my word,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_01069" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Mrs. Norris, as they drove
              through the park.</span>
            <span id="said_no_01070" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"Nothing but pleasure from beginning
              to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for
              contriving to let you go. A pretty good day's amusement you have had!"</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01071" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Maria was just discontented enough to
            say directly,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01072" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maria Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I think <em>you</em>
            have done pretty well yourself, ma'am. Your lap seems full of good things, and here is a
            basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01073" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"My dear, it is only a beautiful
            little heath, which that nice old gardener would make me take; but if it is in your way,
            I will have it in my lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me;
            take great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just like the excellent
            one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker, but my taking
            one of the cheeses. I stood out as long as I could, till the tears almost came into her
            eyes, and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with. That Mrs.
            Whitaker is a treasure! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed
            at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns.
            Take care of the cheese, Fanny. Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very
            well."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01076" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"Spunging, my dear! It is nothing but
            four of those beautiful pheasants' eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me:
            she would not take a denial. She said it must be such an amusement to me, as she
            understood I lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures of that sort; and so to
            be sure it will. I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen, and if
            they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop; and it will
            be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them. And if I have good luck,
            your mother shall have some."</span>

            still, and the drive was as pleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it; but when
            Mrs. Norris ceased speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within. Their
            spirits were in general exhausted; and to determine whether the day had afforded most
            pleasure or pain, might occupy the meditations of almost all.</span>
