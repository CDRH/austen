        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03008" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Crawford's uneasiness was much
            lightened by this conversation, and she walked home again in spirits which might have
            defied almost another week of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they
            been put to the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother down from London
            again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, she had nothing farther to
            try her own. His still refusing to tell her what he had gone for was but the promotion
            of gaiety; a day before it might have irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke—
            suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And
            the next day <em>did</em> bring a surprise to her. Henry had said he
            should just go and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but he was
            gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting for him to walk with her
            in the garden, met him at last most impatiently in the sweep, and cried out, </span>
          <span id="said_no_03009" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"My dear Henry, where can you have
            been all this time?"</span>
          <span id="said_no_03010" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he had only to say that</span>
          <span id="said_no_03011" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_henry" data-placement="auto top">
            he had been sitting with
            Lady Bertram and Fanny.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03012" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Sitting with them an hour and a
            half!"</span>
          <span id="said_no_03013" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">exclaimed Mary.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03014" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">But this was only the beginning of her
            surprise.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03015" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Yes, Mary,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_03016" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said he, drawing her arm within
              his, and walking along the sweep as if not knowing where he was:</span>
            <span id="said_no_03017" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"I could not get away sooner; Fanny
              looked so lovely! I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is entirely made up. Will it
              astonish you? No: you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny
              Price."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03018" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The surprise was now complete; for, in
            spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having any such
            views had never entered his sister's imagination; and she looked so truly the
            astonishment she felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said, and more fully
            and more solemnly. The conviction of his determination once admitted, it was not
            unwelcome. There was even pleasure with the surprise. Mary was in a state of mind to
            rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family, and to be not displeased with her
            brother's marrying a little beneath him.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03019" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Yes, Mary,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_03020" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">was Henry's concluding assurance. </span>
            <span id="said_no_03021" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"I am fairly caught. You know with
              what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them. I have, I flatter myself, made
              no inconsiderable progress in her affections; but my own are entirely fixed."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03022" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Lucky, lucky girl!"</span>
            <span id="said_no_03023" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">cried Mary, as soon as she could
              speak; </span>
            <span id="said_no_03024" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"what a match for her! My dearest
              Henry, this must be my <em>first</em> feeling; but my <em>second</em>, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your choice from
              my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it. You will have
              a sweet little wife; all gratitude and devotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an
              amazing match for her! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck; what will she say now? The
              delight of all the family, indeed! And she has some <em>true</em>
              friends in it! How <em>they</em> will rejoice! But tell me all about it!
              Talk to me for ever. When did you begin to think seriously about her?"</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03025" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Nothing could be more impossible than
            to answer such a question, though nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked.
            "How the pleasing plague had stolen on him" he could not say; and before he had
            expressed the same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over, his
            sister eagerly interrupted him with, </span>
          <span id="said_no_03026" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Ah, my dear Henry, and this is what
            took you to London! This was your business! You chose to consult the Admiral before you
            made up your mind."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03027" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">But this he stoutly denied. He knew
            his uncle too well to consult him on any matrimonial scheme. The Admiral hated marriage,
            and thought it never pardonable in a young man of independent fortune.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03028" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"When Fanny is known to
              him,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_03029" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">continued Henry, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03030" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"he will doat on her. She is
              exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral, for she he
              would describe, if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own
              ideas. But till it is absolutely settled— settled beyond all interference, he shall
              know nothing of the matter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You have not discovered
              my business yet."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03031" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Well, well, I am satisfied. I know
            now to whom it must relate, and am in no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful,
            quite wonderful! That Mansfield should have done so much for— that <em>you</em> should have found your fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could
            not have chosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, and you do not want for
            fortune; and as to her connexions, they are more than good. The Bertrams are undoubtedly
            some of the first people in this country. She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will
            be enough for the world. But go on, go on. Tell me more. What are your plans? Does she
            know her own happiness?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03032" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"No."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03033" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"What are you waiting for?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03034" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"For—for very little more than
            opportunity. Mary, she is not like her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in
            vain."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03035" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Oh no! you cannot. Were you even less
            pleasing— supposing her not to love you already (of which, however, I can have little
            doubt)—you would be safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure
            her all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she would marry you <em>without</em> love; that is, if there is a girl in the world capable of
            being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but ask her to love you, and she
            will never have the heart to refuse."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03036" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">As soon as her eagerness could rest in
            silence, he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen; and a conversation followed
            almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to
            relate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny's charms.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03037" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_henry" data-placement="auto top">
            Fanny's beauty of face
            and figure, Fanny's graces of manner and goodness of heart,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03038" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">were the exhaustless theme.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03039" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_henry" data-placement="auto top">
            The gentleness, modesty,

          <span id="said_no_03040" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">were warmly expatiated on; that
            sweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman's worth in the judgment of man,
            that though he sometimes loves where it is not, he can never believe it absent.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03041" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_henry" data-placement="auto top">
            Her temper he had good
            reason to depend on and to praise. He had often seen it tried. Was there one of the
            family, excepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually exercised her
            patience and forbearance? Her affections were evidently strong. To see her with her
            brother! What could more delightfully prove that the warmth of her heart was equal to
            its gentleness? What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love in view? Then,
            her understanding was beyond every suspicion, quick and clear; and her manners were the
            mirror of her own modest and elegant mind.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03042" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Nor was this all. Henry Crawford had
            too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles in a wife, though he was too
            little accustomed to serious reflection to know them by their proper name; but
            when</span>
          <span id="said_no_03043" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he talked of</span>

            steadiness and regularity of conduct, such a high notion of honour, and such an
            observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith
            and integrity,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03045" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he expressed what was inspired by the
            knowledge of her being well principled and religious.</span>

          <span id="said_no_03049" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Well might his sister, believing as

              most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy.
              Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed. You will both
              find your good in it."</span>

            such a creature; but I did not know her then; and she shall have no reason to lament the
            hour that first put it into my head. I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she
            has ever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else. I will not take her from
            Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in this neighbourhood;
            perhaps Stanwix Lodge. I shall let a seven years' lease of Everingham. I am sure of an
            excellent tenant at half a word. I could name three people now, who would give me my own
            terms and thank me."</span>

            recollected herself, and wished it unsaid; but there was no need of confusion; for her
            brother saw her only as the supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to
            invite her in the kindest manner to his own house, and to claim the best right in

            his, before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions, or learned to sit over your
            dinner as if it were the best blessing of life! <em>You</em> are not
            sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you; but, in my estimation,
            your marrying early may be the saving of you. To have seen you grow like the Admiral in

            possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you <em>loved</em> would be
            the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to love, she would yet find in you
            the liberality and good-breeding of a gentleman."</span>

              returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for
              that stupid woman's service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness, so much
              as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command,
              her hair arranged as neatly as it always is, and one little curl falling forward as
              she wrote, which she now and then shook back, and in the midst of all this, still
              speaking at intervals to <em>me</em>, or listening, and as if she liked
              to listen, to what I said. Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied the

              now see their cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily

              moments' ill flavour, and then be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb
              as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women's, though <em>I</em> was the object of them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a difference indeed: a
              daily, hourly difference, in the behaviour of every being who approaches her; and it
              will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it, that I am the
