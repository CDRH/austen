          <span id="said_no_04120" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">A week was gone since Edmund might be
            supposed in town, and Fanny had heard nothing of him. There were three different
            conclusions to be drawn from his silence, between which her mind was in fluctuation;
            each of them at times being held the most probable.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04121" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            Either his going had
            been again delayed, or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone,
            or he was too happy for letter-writing!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04122" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">One morning, about this time, Fanny
            having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield, a point which she never failed to
            think over and calculate every day, as she and Susan were preparing to remove, as usual,
            upstairs, they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they felt they could not
            avoid, from Rebecca's alertness in going to the door, a duty which always interested her
            beyond any other.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04123" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was a gentleman's voice; it was a
            voice that Fanny was just turning pale about, when Mr. Crawford walked into the
            room.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04124" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Good sense, like hers, will always act
            when really called upon; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother,
            and recall her remembrance of the name, as that of "William's friend," though she could
            not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment.
            The consciousness of his being known there only as William's friend was some support.
            Having introduced him, however, and being all reseated, the terrors that occurred of
            what this visit might lead to were overpowering, and she fancied herself on the point of
            fainting away.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04125" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">While trying to keep herself alive,
            their visitor, who had at first approached her with as animated a countenance as ever,
            was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away, and giving her time to recover, while he
            devoted himself entirely to her mother, addressing her, and attending to her with the
            utmost politeness and propriety, at the same time with a degree of friendliness, of
            interest at least, which was making his manner perfect.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04126" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Price's manners were also at
            their best. Warmed by the sight of such a friend to her son, and regulated by the wish
            of appearing to advantage before him, she was overflowing with gratitude— artless,
            maternal gratitude— which could not be unpleasing.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04127" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_mrsp" data-placement="auto top">
            Mr. Price was out, which
            she regretted very much.</span>

          <span id="said_no_04129" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">was just recovered enough</span>
          <span id="said_no_04130" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">to feel that</span>

            <em>she</em> could not regret it;</span>
          <span id="said_no_04132" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">for to her many other sources of
            uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he found her. She
            might scold herself for the weakness, but there was no scolding it away.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04133" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            She was ashamed, and she
            would have been yet more ashamed of her father than of all the rest.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04134" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">They talked of William, a subject on
            which Mrs. Price could never tire; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as
            even her heart could wish.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04135" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She felt that</span>

          <span id="said_no_04138" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">was only astonished to find

            so great and so agreeable
            as he was, he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port-admiral,
            nor the commissioner, nor yet with the intention of going over to the island, nor of
            seeing the dockyard.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04140" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Nothing of all that she had been used
            to think of as the proof of importance, or the employment of wealth, had brought him to
            Portsmouth.</span>

             He had reached it late
            the night before, was come for a day or two, was staying at the Crown, had accidentally

            not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she was

            he thought himself lucky
            in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having spent scarcely twenty-four hours in London,

            he was well, had left
            them all well at Mansfield, and was to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04158" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny listened collectedly, even to
            the last-mentioned circumstance; nay, it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any
            certainty; and the words, </span>
          <span id="said_no_04159" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"then by this time it is all
            settled,"</span>
          <span id="said_no_04160" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">passed internally, without more
            evidence of emotion than a faint blush.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span id="said_no_04161" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">After talking a little more about
            Mansfield, a subject in which her interest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at
            the expediency of an early walk. </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_04162" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"It was a lovely morning, and at
              that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for
              everybody not to delay their exercise";</span>
            <span id="said_no_04163" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and such hints producing nothing, he
              soon proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her daughters to take
              their walk without loss of time. Now they came to an understanding. Mrs. Price, it
              appeared, scarcely ever stirred out of doors, except of a Sunday;</span>
            <span id="said_no_04164" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she owned</span>
            <span id="said_no_04165" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_mrsp" data-placement="auto top">
              she could seldom, with
              her large family, find time for a walk. </span>
            <span id="said_no_04166" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Would she not, then, persuade her
              daughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him the pleasure of attending
              them?"</span>
          <span id="said_no_04167" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and
            very complying.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04168" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Price" data-placement="auto top">"Her daughters were very much
            confined; Portsmouth was a sad place; they did not often get out; and she knew they had
            some errands in the town, which they would be very glad to do."</span>
          <span id="said_no_04169" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">And the consequence was, that Fanny,
            strange as it was— strange, awkward, and distressing —found herself and Susan, within
            ten minutes, walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford.</span></p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04170" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was soon pain upon pain, confusion
            upon confusion; for they were hardly in the High Street before they met her father,
            whose appearance was not the better from its being Saturday. He stopt; and,
            ungentlemanlike as he looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford. She
            could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford must be struck.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04171" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            He must be ashamed and
            disgusted altogether. He must soon give her up, and cease to have the smallest
            inclination for the match;</span>
          <span id="said_no_04172" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and yet, though she had been so much
            wanting his affection to be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad
            as the complaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms
            who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever, agreeable
            man, than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04173" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mr. Crawford probably could not regard
            his future father-in-law with any idea of taking him for a model in dress; but (as Fanny
            instantly, and to her great relief, discerned) her father was a very different man, a
            very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected stranger, from
            what he was in his own family at home. His manners now, though not polished, were more
            than passable: they were grateful, animated, manly; his expressions were those of an
            attached father, and a sensible man; his loud tones did very well in the open air, and
            there was not a single oath to be heard. Such was his instinctive compliment to the good
            manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the consequence what it might, Fanny's immediate
            feelings were infinitely soothed.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04174" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The conclusion of the two gentlemen's
            civilities was an offer of Mr. Price's to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr.
            Crawford, desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though he had
            seen the dockyard again and again, and</span>
          <span id="said_no_04175" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">hoping</span>
          <span id="said_no_04176" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">to be so much the longer with Fanny,
            was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04177" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_henry" data-placement="auto top">
            if the Miss Prices were
            not afraid of the fatigue;</span>
          <span id="said_no_04178" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and as it was somehow or other
            ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they were not at all afraid, to
            the dockyard they were all to go; and but for Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned
            thither directly, without the smallest consideration for his daughters' errands in the
            High Street. He took care, however, that they should be allowed to go to the shops they
            came out expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long, for Fanny could so little
            bear to excite impatience, or be waited for, that before the gentlemen, as they stood at
            the door, could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations, or settle the number
            of three-deckers now in commission, their companions were ready to proceed.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04179" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">They were then to set forward for the
            dockyard at once, and the walk would have been conducted— according to Mr. Crawford's
            opinion —in a singular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it,
            as the two girls, he found, would have been left to follow, and keep up with them or
            not, as they could, while they walked on together at their own hasty pace. He was able
            to introduce some improvement occasionally, though by no means to the extent he wished;
            he absolutely would not walk away from them; and at any crossing or any crowd, when Mr.
            Price was only calling out, </span>
          <span id="said_no_04180" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Price" data-placement="auto top">"Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue,
            take care of yourselves; keep a sharp lookout!"</span>
          <span id="said_no_04181" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he would give them his particular
            attendance.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04182" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Once fairly in the dockyard, he began
            to reckon upon some happy intercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a
            brother lounger of Mr. Price's, who was come to take his daily survey of how things went
            on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion than himself; and after a time the
            two officers seemed very well satisfied going about together, and discussing matters of
            equal and never-failing interest, while the young people sat down upon some timbers in
            the yard, or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look
            at. Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest. Crawford could not have wished her more
            fatigued or more ready to sit down; but he could have wished her sister away. A
            quick-looking girl of Susan's age was the very worst third in the world: totally
            different from Lady Bertram, all eyes and ears; and there was no introducing the main
            point before her. He must content himself with being only generally agreeable, and
            letting Susan have her share of entertainment, with the indulgence, now and then, of a
            look or hint for the better-informed and conscious Fanny. Norfolk was what he had mostly
            to talk of: there he had been some time, and everything there was rising in importance
            from his present schemes. Such a man could come from no place, no society, without
            importing something to amuse; his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use, and
            Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her. For Fanny, somewhat more was related
            than the accidental agreeableness of the parties he had been in. For her approbation,
            the particular reason of his going into Norfolk at all, at this unusual time of year,
            was given.</span>

            It had been real
            business, relative to the renewal of a lease in which the welfare of a large and— he
            believed —industrious family was at stake. He had suspected his agent of some underhand
            dealing; of meaning to bias him against the deserving; and he had determined to go
            himself, and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case. He had gone, had done even
            more good than he had foreseen, had been useful to more than his first plan had
            comprehended, and was now able to congratulate himself upon it, and to feel that in
            performing a duty, he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind. He had
            introduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before; he had begun making
            acquaintance with cottages whose very existence, though on his own estate, had been
            hitherto unknown to him.</span>
