          <span id="said_no_01224" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Honourable John Yates, this new
            friend, had not much to recommend him beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being
            the younger son of a lord with a tolerable independence; and Sir Thomas would probably
            have thought his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable. Mr. Bertram's
            acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth, where they had spent ten days together in
            the same society, and the friendship, if friendship it might be called, had been proved
            and perfected by Mr. Yates's being invited</span>
          <span id="said_no_01225" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_tom" data-placement="auto top">
            to take Mansfield in his
            way, whenever he could,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01226" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and by his promising to come; and he
            did come rather earlier than had been expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up
            of a large party assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had left
            Weymouth to join. He came on the wings of disappointment, and with his head full of
            acting, for it had been a theatrical party; and the play in which he had borne a part
            was within two days of representation, when the sudden death of one of the nearest
            connexions of the family had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers. To be so
            near happiness, so near fame, so near the long paragraph in praise of the private
            theatricals at Ecclesford, the seat of the Right Hon. Lord Ravenshaw, in Cornwall, which
            would of course have immortalised the whole party for at least a twelvemonth! and being
            so near, to lose it all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates could talk of
            nothing else. Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements and dresses, rehearsals
            and jokes, was his never-failing subject, and to boast of the past his only
            consolation.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01227" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Happily for him, a love of the theatre
            is so general, an itch for acting so strong among young people, that he could hardly
            out-talk the interest of his hearers. From the first casting of the parts to the
            epilogue it was all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to have been a party
            concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill. The play had been Lovers' Vows,
            and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel. </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_01228" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Yates" data-placement="auto top">"A trifling part,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_01229" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said he, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01230" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Yates" data-placement="auto top">"and not at all to my taste, and
              such a one as I certainly would not accept again; but I was determined to make no
              difficulties. Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters
              worth playing before I reached Ecclesford; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign
              his to me, it was impossible to take it, you know. I was sorry for <em>him</em> that he should have so mistaken his powers, for he was no more equal to
              the Baronâ€” a little man with a weak voice, always hoarse after the first ten minutes.
              It must have injured the piece materially; but <em>I</em> was resolved
              to make no difficulties. Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick, but that
              was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself; whereas it was certainly in the best
              hands of the two. I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckily the strength
              of the piece did not depend upon him. Our Agatha was inimitable, and the duke was
              thought very great by many. And upon the whole, it would certainly have gone off
              wonderfully."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01231" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">"It was a hard case, upon my word";
            and, "I do think you were very much to be pitied," were the kind responses of listening
            sympathy.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01232" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Yates" data-placement="auto top">"It is not worth complaining about;
            but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time; and it is
            impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three
            days we wanted. It was but three days; and being only a grandmother, and all happening
            two hundred miles off, I think there would have been no great harm, and it was
            suggested, I know; but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose is one of the most correct men in
            England, would not hear of it."</span>

            <span id="said_no_01235" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Tom Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Lovers' Vows were at an end, and
              Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by themselves. Well, the jointure
              may comfort <em>him</em>; and perhaps, between friends, he began to
              tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and
              to make <em>you</em> amends, Yates, I think we must raise a little
              theatre at Mansfield, and ask you to be our manager."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01236" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">This, though the thought of the
            moment, did not end with the moment; for the inclination to act was awakened, and in no
            one more strongly than in him who was now master of the house; and who, having so much
            leisure as to make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise such a degree of
            lively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to the novelty of acting. The
            thought returned again and again. "Oh for the Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try
            something with." Each sister could echo the wish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all
            the riot of his gratifications it was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the
            idea. </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_01237" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"I really believe,"</span>

              moment to undertake any character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III
              down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel as if I
              could be anything or everything; as if I could rant and storm, or sigh or cut capers,
              in any tragedy or comedy in the English language. Let us be doing something. Be it
              only half a play, an act, a scene; what should prevent us? Not these countenances, I
              am sure,"</span>

              a theatre? We shall be only amusing ourselves. Any room in this house might

              matter what, with a good tricking, shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a
              hornpipe, and a song between the acts. If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do

            real acting; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw
            efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who
            have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through."</span>

          <span id="said_no_01258" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">After a short pause, however, the
            subject still continued, and was discussed with unabated eagerness, every one's
            inclination increasing by the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the
            rest; and though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy, and his
            sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the world could be easier than
            to find a piece which would please them all, the resolution to act something or other
            seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable. He was determined to prevent
            it, if possible, though his mother, who equally heard the conversation which passed at
            table, did not evince the least disapprobation.</span>

          <span id="said_no_01259" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The same evening afforded him an
            opportunity of trying his strength. Maria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates were in
            the billiard-room. Tom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was
            standing thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little
            distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work, thus began as he
            enteredâ€”</span>
          <span id="said_no_01260" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Tom Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Such a horribly vile billiard-table as
            ours is not to be met with, I believe, above ground. I can stand it no longer, and I
            think, I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again; but one good thing I
            have just ascertained: it is the very room for a theatre, precisely the shape and length
            for it; and the doors at the farther end, communicating with each other, as they may be
            made to do in five minutes, by merely moving the bookcase in my father's room, is the
            very thing we could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it; and my father's
            room will be an excellent greenroom. It seems to join the billiard-room on
            purpose."</span>

            but as <em>we</em> are circumstanced, I must think it would be highly
            injudicious, and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind. It would shew
            great want of feeling on my father's account, absent as he is, and in some degree of
            constant danger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose
            situation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely delicate."</span>

            if we were going to act three times a week till my father's return, and invite all the
            country. But it is not to be a display of that sort. We mean nothing but a little
            amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something
            new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I think, in chusing some play
            most perfectly unexceptionable; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of
            us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in
            chattering in words of our own. I have no fears and no scruples. And as to my father's
            being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I consider it rather as a motive; for
            the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can
            be the means of amusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks,
            I shall think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will he. It is a <em>very</em> anxious period for her."</span>

            Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my
            father, and for anything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always a
            decided taste. I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys. How many a time have we mourned
            over the dead body of Julius Caesar, and to <em>be'd</em> and not <em>to</em>
            <em>be'd</em>, in this very room, for his amusement? And I am sure, <em>my</em>

            of a theatre we must have undoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green
            curtain and a little carpenter's work, and that's all; and as the carpenter's work may
            be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be too absurd to talk of
            expense; and as long as Jackson is employed, everything will be right with Sir Thomas.
