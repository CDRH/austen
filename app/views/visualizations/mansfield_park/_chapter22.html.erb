        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02034" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny's consequence increased on the
            departure of her cousins. Becoming, as she then did, the only young woman in the
            drawing-room, the only occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she
            had hitherto held so humble a third, it was impossible for her not to be more looked at,
            more thought of and attended to, than she had ever been before; and "Where is Fanny?"
            became no uncommon question, even without her being wanted for any one's
            convenience.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02035" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Not only at home did her value
            increase, but at the Parsonage too. In that house, which she had hardly entered twice a
            year since Mr. Norris's death, she became a welcome, an invited guest, and in the gloom
            and dirt of a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford. Her visits there,
            beginning by chance, were continued by solicitation. Mrs. Grant, really eager to get any
            change for her sister, could, by the easiest self-deceit, persuade herself that she was
            doing the kindest thing by Fanny, and giving her the most important opportunities of
            improvement in pressing her frequent calls.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02036" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny, having been sent into the
            village on some errand by her aunt Norris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the
            Parsonage; and being descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter under
            the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their premises, was forced,
            though not without some modest reluctance on her part, to come in. A civil servant she
            had withstood; but when Dr. Grant himself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing
            to be done but to be very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible;
            and to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal rain in a very
            desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that
            morning, and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond themselves for the next
            twenty-four hours, the sound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss
            Price dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful. The value of an event on a wet
            day in the country was most forcibly brought before her. She was all alive again
            directly, and among the most active in being useful to Fanny, in detecting her to be
            wetter than she would at first allow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny,
            after being obliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and waited on
            by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning downstairs, to be fixed in
            their drawing-room for an hour while the rain continued, the blessing of something fresh
            to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits
            to the period of dressing and dinner.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02037" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The two sisters were so kind to her,
            and so pleasant, that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself
            not in the way, and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at
            the end of the hour, and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant's carriage and
            horses out to take her home, with which she was threatened. As to anxiety for any alarm
            that her absence in such weather might occasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on
            that score; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly
            aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to
            establish her during the rain, her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt
            Bertram.</span>

          <span id="said_no_02045" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">which could hardly be believed,</span>

          <span id="said_no_02048" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">To Fanny herself it appeared a very
            simple and natural circumstance. She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since the
            instrument's arrival, there had been no reason that she should; but Miss Crawford,
            calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject, was concerned at her own
            neglect; and </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_02049" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Shall I play to you now?"</span>

          <span id="said_no_02052" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> were questions immediately following
            with the readiest good-humour.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02053" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She played accordingly; happy to have
            a new listener, and a listener who seemed so much obliged, so full of wonder at the
            performance, and who shewed herself not wanting in taste. She played till Fanny's eyes,
            straying to the window on the weather's being evidently fair, spoke what she felt must
            be done.</span>
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_02058" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> said Fanny.</span>

          <span id="said_no_02060" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"South or north, I know a black cloud
            when I see it; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening. And besides, I
            want to play something more to you— a very pretty piece— and your cousin Edmund's prime
            favourite. You must stay and hear your cousin's favourite."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02061" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny felt that she must; and though
            she had not waited for that sentence to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her
            particularly awake to his idea, and she fancied him sitting in that room again and
            again, perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with constant delight to
            the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her, with superior tone and expression; and
            though pleased with it herself, and glad to like whatever was liked by him, she was more
            sincerely impatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before; and on
            this being evident,</span>
          <span id="said_no_02062" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she was so kindly asked</span>
          <span id="said_no_02063" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_mary" data-placement="auto top">
            to call again, to take
            them in her walk whenever she could, to come and hear more of the harp,</span>
          <span id="said_no_02064" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">that she felt it necessary to be done,
            if no objection arose at home.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02065" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Such was the origin of the sort of
            intimacy which took place between them within the first fortnight after the Miss
            Bertrams' going away— an intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford's desire of
            something new, and which had little reality in Fanny's feelings. Fanny went to her every
            two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she could not be easy without going,
            and yet it was without loving her, without ever thinking like her, without any sense of
            obligation for being sought after now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no
            higher pleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement, and <em>that</em> often at the expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry on
            people or subjects which she wished to be respected. She went, however, and they
            sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs. Grant's shrubbery, the weather being
            unusually mild for the time of year, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of
            the benches now comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the midst of
            some tender ejaculation of Fanny's on the sweets of so protracted an autumn, they were
            forced, by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about
            them, to jump up and walk for warmth.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_02066" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"This is pretty, very
              pretty,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_02067" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">said Fanny, looking around her as
              they were thus sitting together one day; </span>
            <span id="said_no_02068" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"every time I come into this
              shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty. Three years ago, this was
              nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field, never thought of as
              anything, or capable of becoming anything; and now it is converted into a walk, and it
              would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament; and
              perhaps, in another three years, we may be forgetting— almost forgetting what it was
              before. How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and the changes of
              the human mind!"</span>
            <span id="said_no_02069" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">And following the latter train of
              thought, she soon afterwards added: </span>
            <span id="said_no_02070" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"If any one faculty of our nature
              may be called <em>more</em> wonderful than the rest, I do think it is
              memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the
              failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The
              memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so
              bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are,
              to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do
              seem peculiarly past finding out."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02071" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Crawford, untouched and
            inattentive, had nothing to say; and Fanny, perceiving it, brought back her own mind to
            what she thought must interest.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02072" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"It may seem impertinent in <em>me</em> to praise, but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in
            all this. There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk! Not too much
            attempted!"</span>

              to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind."</span>

              of the laurels and evergreens in general. The evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome,
              how wonderful the evergreen! When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of
              nature! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but
              that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture
              plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence. You will think me
              rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especially when I am sitting out of doors, I
              am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain. One cannot fix one's eyes on

            reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be. I can even suppose it
            pleasant to spend <em>half</em> the year in the country, under certain
            circumstances, very pleasant. An elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of family
            connexions; continual engagements among them; commanding the first society in the
            neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading it even more than those of larger

            aunt's account, could not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing
            her, and therefore</span>
