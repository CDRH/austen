            travelling back, to London, on the morrow, for nothing more was seen of him at Mr.
            Price's; and two days afterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following
            letter from his sister, opened and read by her, on another account, with the most
            anxious curiosity:—</span>

                Henry has been down

                he had a delightful
                walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the
                next day, on the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweet
                looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony, and afforded
                sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.</span>
              <span id="said_no_04296" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">This, as well as I understand, is
                to be the substance of my information. He makes me write, but I do not know what
                else is to be communicated, except this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said
                walks, and</span>

                his introduction to
                your family, especially to a fair sister of yours, a fine girl of fifteen, who was
                of the party on the ramparts,</span>
              <span id="said_no_04298" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">taking her first lesson, I
                presume, in love. I have not time for writing much, but it would be out of place if
                I had, for this is to be a mere letter of business, penned for the purpose of
                conveying necessary information, which could not be delayed without risk of evil. My
                dear, dear Fanny, if I had you here, how I would talk to you! You should listen to
                me till you were tired, and advise me till you were still tired more; but it is
                impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper, so I will abstain
                altogether, and leave you to guess what you like. I have no news for you. You have
                politics, of course; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people
                and parties that fill up my time. I ought to have sent you an account of your
                cousin's first party, but I was lazy, and now it is too long ago; suffice it, that
                everything was just as it ought to be, in a style that any of her connexions must
                have been gratified to witness, and that her own dress and manners did her the
                greatest credit. My friend, Mrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and it would not
                make <em>me</em> miserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter; she
                seems in high spirits, and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured and
                pleasant in his own family, and I do not think him so very ill-looking as I did— at
                least, one sees many worse. He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund. Of the
                last-mentioned hero, what shall I say? If I avoided his name entirely, it would look
                suspicious. I will say, then, that we have seen him two or three times, and that my
                friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance.</span>

                here the other day, there were none to compare with him, and we were a party of

                Edmund's fault: he gets into my head more than does me good) one very material thing
                I had to say from Henry and myself— I mean about our taking you back into
                Northamptonshire. My dear little creature, do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your
                pretty looks. Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health. My poor aunt
                always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral of course
                never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service and Henry's, at an hour's
                notice. I should like the scheme, and we would make a little circuit, and shew you
                Everingham in our way, and perhaps you would not mind passing through London, and
                seeing the inside of St. George's, Hanover Square. Only keep your cousin Edmund from
                me at such a time: I should not like to be tempted. What a long letter! one word
                more.</span>

            before the middle of next week; that is, he cannot anyhow be spared till after the 14th,
            for <em>we</em> have a party that evening. The value of a man like Henry,
            on such an occasion, is what you can have no conception of; so you must take it upon my
            word to be inestimable. He will see the Rushworths, which own I am not sorry for— having
            a little curiosity, and so I think has he— though he will not acknowledge it."</span>

            The only certainty to be
            drawn from it was, that nothing decisive had yet taken place. Edmund had not yet
            spoken.</span>

            How Miss Crawford really
            felt, how she meant to act, or might act without or against her meaning; whether his
            importance to her were quite what it had been before the last separation; whether, if
            lessened, it were likely to lessen more, or to recover itself,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04313" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">were subjects for endless conjecture,
            and to be thought of on that day and many days to come, without producing any
            conclusion.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04314" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The idea that returned the oftenest

            Miss Crawford, after
            proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits, would yet prove
            herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up. She would try to be more
            ambitious than her heart would allow. She would hesitate, she would tease, she would
            condition, she would require a great deal, but she would finally accept.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04316" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was Fanny's most frequent
            expectation.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04317" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_9" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            A house in town—

          <span id="said_no_04318" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she thought,</span>

            must be impossible. Yet
            there was no saying what Miss Crawford might not ask. The prospect for her cousin grew
            worse and worse. The woman who could speak of him, and speak only of his appearance!
            What an unworthy attachment! To be deriving support from the commendations of Mrs.
            Fraser! <em>She</em> who had known him intimately half a year!</span>
          <span id="said_no_04320" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny was ashamed of her. Those parts
            of the letter which related only to Mr. Crawford and herself, touched her, in
            comparison, slightly.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04321" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            Whether Mr. Crawford
            went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no concern of hers, though,
            everything considered,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04322" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she thought</span>

            he <em>would</em> go without delay. That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting
            between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of conduct, and grossly unkind
            and ill-judged; but</span>
          <span id="said_no_04324" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she hoped</span>

            <em>he</em> would not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He
            acknowledged no such inducement, and his sister ought to have given him credit for
            better feelings than her own.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04326" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She was yet more impatient for another
            letter from town after receiving this than she had been before; and for a few days was
            so unsettled by it altogether, by what had come, and what might come, that her usual
            readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended. She could not command her
            attention as she wished.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04327" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            If Mr. Crawford
            remembered her message to her cousin,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04328" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she thought</span>
          <span id="said_no_04329" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            it very likely, most
            likely, that he would write to her at all events; it would be most consistent with his
            usual kindness;</span>
          <span id="said_no_04330" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and till she got rid of this idea,
            till it gradually wore off, by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days
            more, she was in a most restless, anxious state.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04331" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">At length, a something like composure
            succeeded.</span>

            Suspense must be
            submitted to, and must not be allowed to wear her out, and make her useless.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04333" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Time did something, her own exertions
            something more, and she resumed her attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same
            interest in them.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04334" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Susan was growing very fond of her,
            and though without any of the early delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny,
            with a disposition much less inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for
            information's sake, she had so strong a desire of not <em>appearing</em>
            ignorant, as, with a good clear understanding, made her a most attentive, profitable,
            thankful pupil. Fanny was her oracle. Fanny's explanations and remarks were a most
            important addition to every essay, or every chapter of history. What Fanny told her of
            former times dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she paid her sister
            the compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author. The early habit of
            reading was wanting.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04335" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Their conversations, however, were not
            always on subjects so high as history or morals. Others had their hour; and of lesser
            matters, none returned so often, or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park, a
            description of the people, the manners, the amusements, the ways of Mansfield Park.
            Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel and well-appointed, was eager to hear,
            and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04336" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She hoped</span>

            it was not wrong;</span>
          <span id="said_no_04338" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">though, after a time, Susan's very
            great admiration of everything said or done in her uncle's house, and earnest longing to
            go into Northamptonshire, seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings which could
            not be gratified.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04339" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Poor Susan was very little better
            fitted for home than her elder sister; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand
            this,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04340" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she began to feel that</span>
          <span id="said_no_04341" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            when her own release
            from Portsmouth came, her happiness would have a material drawback in leaving Susan
            behind. That a girl so capable of being made everything good should be left in such
            hands,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04342" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">distressed her more and more.</span>

            Were <em>she</em> likely to have a home to invite her to, what a blessing it would be!</span>
          <span id="said_no_04344" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            And had it been possible
            for her to return Mr. Crawford's regard, the probability of his being very far from
            objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her own
            comforts.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04345" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She thought</span>

            he was really
            good-tempered, and could fancy his entering into a plan of that sort most
            pleasantly.</span>
