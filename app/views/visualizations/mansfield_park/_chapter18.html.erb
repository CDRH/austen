        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01667" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Everything was now in a regular train:
            theatre, actors, actresses, and dresses, were all getting forward; but though no other
            great impediments arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was not all
            uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she had not to witness the
            continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost too much for her at first.
            Everybody began to have their vexation.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01668" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edmund had many.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01669" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
             Entirely against <em>his</em> judgment, a scene-painter arrived from town, and was at work,
            much to the increase of the expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their
            proceedings; and his brother, instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of
            the representation, was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01670" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Tom himself began to fret over the
            scene-painter's slow progress, and to feel the miseries of waiting. He had learned his
            part— all his parts, for he took every trifling one that could be united with the
            Butler, and began to be impatient to be acting; and every day thus unemployed was
            tending to increase his sense of the insignificance of all his parts together, and make
            him more ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01671" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny, being always a very courteous
            listener, and often the only listener at hand, came in for the complaints and the
            distresses of most of them. <em>She</em> knew that Mr. Yates was in
            general thought to rant dreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford;
            that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant spoiled
            everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his part, and that it was misery
            to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth, who was wanting a prompter through every
            speech. She knew, also, that poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse
            with him: <em>his</em> complaint came before her as well as the rest; and
            so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria's avoidance of him, and so needlessly often
            the rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she had soon all the
            terror of other complaints from <em>him</em>. So far from being all
            satisfied and all enjoying, she found everybody requiring something they had not, and
            giving occasion of discontent to the others.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01672" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            Everybody had a part
            either too long or too short; nobody would attend as they ought; nobody would remember
            on which side they were to come in; nobody but the complainer would observe any
            directions.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01673" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny believed herself to derive as
            much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it
            was a pleasure to <em>her</em> to creep into the theatre, and attend the
            rehearsal of the first act, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for
            Maria. Maria, she also thought, acted well, too well; and after the first rehearsal or
            two, Fanny began to be their only audience; and sometimes as prompter, sometimes as
            spectator, was often very useful. As far as she could judge, Mr. Crawford was
            considerably the best actor of all: he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment
            than Tom, more talent and taste than Mr. Yates. She did not like him as a man, but she
            must admit him to be the best actor, and on this point there were not many who differed
            from her. Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed against his tameness and insipidity; and the day
            came at last, when Mr. Rushworth turned to her with a black look, and said, </span>
          <span id="said_no_01674" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Rushworth" data-placement="auto top">"Do you think there is anything so
            very fine in all this? For the life and soul of me, I cannot admire him; and, between
            ourselves, to see such an undersized, little, mean-looking man, set up for a fine actor,
            is very ridiculous in my opinion."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01675" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">From this moment there was a return of
            his former jealousy, which Maria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains
            to remove; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth's ever attaining to the knowledge of his
            two-and-forty speeches became much less. As to his ever making anything <em>tolerable</em> of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that except his
            mother;</span>
          <span id="said_no_01676" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">
            <em>she</em>, indeed,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01677" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_mrsr" data-placement="auto top">
            regretted that his part
            was not more considerable,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01678" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and deferred coming over to Mansfield
            till they were forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes; but the
            others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword, and the first line of
            his speech, and being able to follow the prompter through the rest. Fanny, in her pity
            and kindheartedness, was at great pains to teach him how to learn, giving him all the
            helps and directions in her power, trying to make an artificial memory for him, and
            learning every word of his part herself, but without his being much the
            forwarder.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01679" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Many uncomfortable, anxious,
            apprehensive feelings she certainly had; but with all these, and other claims on her
            time and attention, she was as far from finding herself without employment or utility
            amongst them, as without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from having no demand
            on her leisure as on her compassion. The gloom of her first anticipations was proved to
            have been unfounded. She was occasionally useful to all; she was perhaps as much at
            peace as any.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01680" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was a great deal of needlework
            to be done, moreover, in which her help was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her
            quite as well off as the rest, was evident by the manner in which she claimed it—</span>
          
            <span id="said_no_01681" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"Come, Fanny,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_01682" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she cried, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01683" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"these are fine times for you, but
              you must not be always walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on
              at your ease, in this way; I want you here. I have been slaving myself till I can
              hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth's cloak without sending for any more satin;
              and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together. There are but three
              seams; you may do them in a trice. It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the
              executive part to do. <em>You</em> are best off, I can tell you: but if
              nobody did more than <em>you</em>, we should not get on very
              fast."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01684" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny took the work very quietly,
            without attempting any defence; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her
            behalf—</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01685" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"One cannot wonder, sister, that
            Fanny <em>should</em> be delighted: it is all new to her, you know; you
            and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a
            little more at leisure, <em>I</em> mean to look in at their rehearsals
            too. What is the play about, Fanny? you have never told me."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01686" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"Oh! sister, pray do not ask her now;
            for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time. It is about
            Lovers' Vows."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01687" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"I believe,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_01688" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, </span>
            <span id="said_no_01689" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"there will be three acts rehearsed
              to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at
              once."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01690" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"You had better stay till the
              curtain is hung,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_01691" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">interposed Mrs. Norris;</span>
            <span id="said_no_01692" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"the curtain will be hung in a day
              or two— there is very little sense in a play without a curtain—and I am much mistaken
              if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01693" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to
            waiting. Fanny did not share her aunt's composure: she thought of the morrow a great
            deal, for if the three acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be
            acting together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene between them which
            interested her most particularly, and which she was longing and dreading to see how they
            would perform. The whole subject of it was love— — a marriage of love was to be
            described by the gentleman, and very little short of a declaration of love be made by
            the lady.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01694" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She had read and read the scene again
            with many painful, many wondering emotions, and looked forward to their representation
            of it as a circumstance almost too interesting. She did not <em>believe</em> they had yet rehearsed it, even in private.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01695" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The morrow came, the plan for the
            evening continued, and Fanny's consideration of it did not become less agitated. She
            worked very diligently under her aunt's directions, but her diligence and her silence
            concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon she made her escape with her work
            to the East room, that she might have no concern in another, and, as she deemed it, most
            unnecessary rehearsal of the first act, which Henry Crawford was just proposing,
            desirous at once of having her time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr.
            Rushworth. A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladies walking up from
            the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat, and she worked and meditated in the
            East room, undisturbed, for a quarter of an hour, when a gentle tap at the door was
            followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01696" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Am I right? Yes; this is the East
            room. My dear Miss Price, I beg your pardon, but I have made my way to you on purpose to
            entreat your help."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01697" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to
            shew herself mistress of the room by her civilities, and looked at the bright bars of
            her empty grate with concern.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01698" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Thank you; I am quite warm, very
            warm. Allow me to stay here a little while, and do have the goodness to hear me my third
            act. I have brought my book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be <em>so</em> obliged! I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund
            —by ourselves— against the evening, but he is not in the way; and if he <em>were</em>, I do not think I could go through it with <em>him</em>, till I have hardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two.
            You will be so good, won't you?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01699" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny was most civil in her
            assurances, though she could not give them in a very steady voice.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_01700" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Have you ever happened to look at
              the part I mean?"</span>
            <span id="said_no_01701" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">continued Miss Crawford, opening her
              book. </span>
            <span id="said_no_01702" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Here it is. I did not think much of
              it at first—but, upon my word. There, look at <em>that</em> speech, and
                <em>that</em>, and <em>that</em>. How am I ever to look
              him in the face and say such things? Could you do it? But then he is your cousin,
              which makes all the difference. You must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy <em>you</em> him, and get on by degrees. You <em>have</em> a
              look of <em>his</em> sometimes."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01703" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"Have I? I will do my best with the
            greatest readiness; but I must <em>read</em> the part, for I can say very
            little of it."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01704" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"<em>None</em> of it, I
            suppose. You are to have the book, of course. Now for it. We must have two chairs at
            hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage. There— very good school-room
            chairs, not made for a theatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and
            kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson. What would your governess and
            your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose? Could Sir Thomas look in upon us
            just now, he would bless himself, for we are rehearsing all over the house. Yates is
            storming away in the dining-room. I heard him as I came upstairs, and the theatre is
            engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick. If <em>they</em> are not perfect, I <em>shall</em> be surprised.
            By the bye, I looked in upon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one
            of the times when they were trying <em>not</em> to embrace, and Mr.
            Rushworth was with me. I thought he began to look a little queer, so I turned it off as
            well as I could, by whispering to him, 'We shall have an excellent Agatha; there is
            something so <em>maternal</em> in her manner, so completely <em>maternal</em> in her voice and countenance.' Was not that well done of
            me? He brightened up directly. Now for my soliloquy."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01705" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She began, and Fanny joined in with
            all the modest feeling which the idea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated
            to inspire; but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of
            a man. With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough; and they had got
            through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought a pause, and the entrance of
            Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01706" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure
            appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the
            very same business that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure were
            likely to be more than momentary in <em>them</em>.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01707" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He</span>
          <span id="said_no_01708" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">too had his book, and was seeking

          <span id="said_no_01709" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            to ask her to rehearse with
            him, and help him to prepare for the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the
            house;</span>
          <span id="said_no_01710" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and great was the joy and animation of
            being thus thrown together, of comparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny's
            kind offices.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01711" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"><em>She</em> could not
            equal them in their warmth. <em>Her</em> spirits sank under the glow of
            theirs, and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in
            having been sought by either. They must now rehearse together. Edmund proposed, urged,
            entreated it, till the lady, not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and
            Fanny was wanted only to prompt and observe them. She was invested, indeed, with the
            office of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their
            faults; but from doing so every feeling within her shrank—</span>

            she could not, would
            not, dared not attempt it:</span>
          <span id="said_no_01713" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> had she been otherwise qualified for
            criticism, her conscience must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation. She
            believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in
            particulars. To prompt them must be enough for her; and it was sometimes <em>more</em> than enough; for she could not always pay attention to the
            book. In watching them she forgot herself; and, agitated by the increasing spirit of
            Edmund's manner, had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help. It
            was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she was thanked and pitied; but she
            deserved their pity more than she hoped they would ever surmise. At last the scene was
            over, and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the
            other; and when again alone and able to recall the whole,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01714" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she was inclined</span>

            to believe their
            performance would, indeed, have such nature and feeling in it as must ensure their
            credit, and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself.</span>

          <span id="said_no_01717" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The first regular rehearsal of the
            three first acts was certainly to take place in the evening: Mrs. Grant and the
            Crawfords were engaged to return for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner;
            and every one concerned was looking forward with eagerness. There seemed a general
            diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion. Tom was enjoying such an advance towards the
            end; Edmund was in spirits from the morning's rehearsal, and little vexations seemed
            everywhere smoothed away. All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the
            gentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and
            Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour; and having lighted it up as well
            as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the
            Crawfords to begin.</span>

            non-attendance was sad indeed. Her pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her
            always valuable amongst them; but <em>now</em> she was absolutely
            necessary.</span>

            They could not act, they
            could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her. The comfort of the whole evening

          <span id="said_no_01727" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Tom, as Cottager, was in despair.
            After a pause of perplexity, some eyes began to be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or
            two to say, "If Miss Price would be so good as to <em>read</em> the part."
            She was immediately surrounded by supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, </span>
          <span id="said_no_01728" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Do, Fanny, if it is not <em>very</em> disagreeable to you."</span>

            Why was not Miss
            Crawford to be applied to as well? Or why had not she rather gone to her own room, as
            she had felt to be safest, instead of attending the rehearsal at all? She had known it
            would irritate and distress her; she had known it her duty to keep away. She was
            properly punished.</span>
