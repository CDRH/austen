            object was that he should be missed; and he entertained great hope that his niece would
            find a blank in the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt, or fancied,
            an evil.</span>

            She had tasted of
            consequence in its most flattering form; and he did hope that the loss of it, the
            sinking again into nothing, would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03806" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He watched her with this idea; but he
            could hardly tell with what success. He hardly knew whether there were any difference in
            her spirits or not. She was always so gentle and retiring that her emotions were beyond
            his discrimination. He did not understand her: he felt that he did not; and therefore
            applied to Edmund</span>
          <span id="said_no_03807" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">to tell him</span>

            the present occasion, and whether she were more or less happy than she had been.</span>

            Crawford's sister, the
            friend and companion who had been so much to her, should not be more visibly
            regretted.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03814" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He wondered that</span>

            Fanny spoke so seldom of
              <em>her</em>, and had so little voluntarily to say of her concern at
            this separation.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03816" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Alas! it was this sister, this friend
            and companion, who was now the chief bane of Fanny's comfort. If she could have believed
            Mary's future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother's
            should be, if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much
            inclined to think his, she would have been light of heart indeed; but the more she
            recollected and observed, the more deeply was</span>
          <span id="said_no_03817" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she convinced that</span>

            everything was now in a
            fairer train for Miss Crawford's marrying Edmund than it had ever been before.</span>

            On his side the
            inclination was stronger, on hers less equivocal. His objections, the scruples of his
            integrity, seemed all done away, nobody could tell how; and the doubts and hesitations
            of her ambition were equally got over— and equally without apparent reason. It could
            only be imputed to increasing attachment. His good and her bad feelings yielded to love,
            and such love must unite them.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03820" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            He was to go to town as
            soon as some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed— perhaps within a
            fortnight; he talked of going, he loved to talk of it; and when once with her again,
            Fanny could not doubt the rest.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03821" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            Her acceptance must be

          <span id="said_no_03823" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">there were bad feelings</span>
          <span id="said_no_03824" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">still remaining which made the
            prospect of it most sorrowful to her, independently, she believed, independently of

            In their very last
            conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite of some amiable sensations, and much personal
            kindness, had still been Miss Crawford; still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered,
            and without any suspicion of being so; darkened, yet fancying itself light. She might
            love, but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03826" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny believed</span>

            there was scarcely a
            second feeling in common between them;</span>
          <span id="said_no_03828" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she may be forgiven by older sages
            for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford's future improvement as nearly desperate,
            for</span>
          <span id="said_no_03829" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">thinking that</span>

            if Edmund's influence in
            this season of love had already done so little in clearing her judgment, and regulating
            her notions, his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03831" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Experience might have hoped more for
            any young people so circumstanced, and impartiality would not have denied to Miss
            Crawford's nature that participation of the general nature of women which would lead her
            to adopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own. But as such were
            Fanny's persuasions, she suffered very much from them, and could never speak of Miss
            Crawford without pain.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03832" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with
            his own hopes and his own observations, still feeling a right, by all his knowledge of
            human nature, to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence on his
            niece's spirits, and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving for their
            return; and he was soon afterwards able to account for his not yet completely and
            indubitably seeing all this, by the prospect of another visitor, whose approach he could
            allow to be quite enough to support the spirits he was watching. William had obtained a
            ten days' leave of absence, to be given to Northamptonshire, and was coming, the
            happiest of lieutenants, because the latest made, to shew his happiness and describe his
            uniform.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03833" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He came; and he would have been
            delighted to shew his uniform there too, had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance
            except on duty. So the uniform remained at Portsmouth, and</span>
          <span id="said_no_03834" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edmund conjectured that</span>

            before Fanny had any chance
            of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the freshness of its wearer's feelings must
            be worn away. It would be sunk into a badge of disgrace; for what can be more
            unbecoming, or more worthless, than the uniform of a lieutenant, who has been a
            lieutenant a year or two, and sees others made commanders before him?</span>
          <span id="said_no_03836" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">So reasoned Edmund,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03837" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">till his father made him the confidant
            of a scheme which placed Fanny's chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush
            in all his glory in another light.</span>

          <span id="said_no_03838" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">This scheme was that</span>

            she should accompany her
            brother back to Portsmouth, and spend a little time with her own family.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03840" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">It had occurred to Sir Thomas,</span>

          <span id="said_no_03844" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">but before he absolutely made up his
            mind, he consulted his son.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03845" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edmund considered it</span>
          <span id="said_no_03846" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">every way, and saw nothing but what
            was right.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03847" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            The thing was good in
            itself, and could not be done at a better time; and he had no doubt of it being highly
            agreeable to Fanny.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03848" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was enough to determine Sir
            Thomas; and a decisive </span>

            Thomas retiring from it with some feelings of satisfaction, and views of good over and
            above what he had communicated to his son; for his prime motive in sending her away had
            very little to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again, and nothing at all
            with any idea of making her happy. He certainly wished her to go willingly, but he as
            certainly</span>
          <span id="said_no_03851" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            wished her to be heartily
            sick of home before her visit ended; and that a little abstinence from the elegancies
            and luxuries of Mansfield Park would bring her mind into a sober state, and incline her
            to a juster estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence, and equal comfort,
            of which she had the offer.</span>

            It was a medicinal
            project upon his niece's understanding, which he must consider as at present diseased. A
            residence of eight or nine years in the abode of wealth and plenty had a little
            disordered her powers of comparing and judging. Her father's house would, in all
            probability, teach her the value of a good income; and he trusted that she would be the
            wiser and happier woman, all her life, for the experiment he had devised.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03853" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Had Fanny been at all addicted to
            raptures, she must have had a strong attack of them when she first understood what was
            intended, when her uncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,
            and sisters, from whom she had been divided almost half her life; of returning for a
            couple of months to the scenes of her infancy, with William for the protector and
            companion of her journey, and the certainty of continuing to see William to the last
            hour of his remaining on land. Had she ever given way to bursts of delight, it must have
            been then, for she was delighted, but her happiness was of a quiet, deep, heart-swelling
            sort; and though never a great talker, she was always more inclined to silence when
            feeling most strongly. At the moment she could only thank and accept. Afterwards, when
            familiarised with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could speak more
            largely to William and Edmund of what she felt; but still there were emotions of
            tenderness that could not be clothed in words. The remembrance of all her earliest
            pleasures, and of what she had suffered in being torn from them, came over her with
            renewed strength, and it seemed as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had
            since grown out of the separation.</span>

            To be in the centre of
            such a circle, loved by so many, and more loved by all than she had ever been before; to
            feel affection without fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal of those who
            surrounded her; to be at peace from all mention of the Crawfords, safe from every look
            which could be fancied a reproach on their account.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03855" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was a prospect to be dwelt on

            Edmund, too —to be two
            months from <em>him</em> (and perhaps she might be allowed to make her
            absence three) must do her good. At a distance, unassailed by his looks or his kindness,
            and safe from the perpetual irritation of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his
            confidence, she should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she should be
            able to think of him as in London, and arranging everything there, without wretchedness.
            What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield was to become a slight evil at
            Portsmouth.</span>

            The only drawback was
            the doubt of her aunt Bertram's being comfortable without her. She was of use to no one
            else; but <em>there</em> she might be missed to a degree that she did not
            like to think of;</span>
          <span id="said_no_03858" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and that part of the arrangement was,

            When he had really resolved on any measure, he could always carry it through; and now by
            dint of long talking on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny's
            sometimes seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go; obtaining it rather
            from submission, however, than conviction, for</span>

            a fearful temper, or been unreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so
            many could deserve. Now, when she knew better how to be useful, and how to forbear, and
            when her mother could be no longer occupied by the incessant demands of a house full of

            their journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of, and Mrs. Norris found that
            all her anxiety to save her brother-in-law's money was vain, and that in spite of her
            wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny, they were to travel post;
            when she saw Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose, she was struck with
