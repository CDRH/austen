          <span id="said_no_02800" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her uncle and both her aunts were in
            the drawing-room when Fanny went down. To the former she was an interesting object, and
            he saw with pleasure the general elegance of her appearance, and her being in remarkably
            good looks. The neatness and propriety of her dress was all that he would allow himself
            to commend in her presence, but upon her leaving the room again soon afterwards, he
            spoke of her beauty with very decided praise.</span>

            <span id="said_no_02805" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">cried Mrs. Norris, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02806" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"she has good reason to look well
              with all her advantages: brought up in this family as she has been, with all the
              benefit of her cousins' manners before her. Only think, my dear Sir Thomas, what
              extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of giving her. The very gown
              you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs.
              Rushworth married. What would she have been if we had not taken her by the
              hand?"</span>

        <p><span id="said_no_02807" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas said no more; but when
            they sat down to table the eyes of the two young men assured him that the subject might
            be gently touched again, when the ladies withdrew, with more success. Fanny saw that she
            was approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still better. From a
            variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon made still happier; for in following
            her aunts out of the room, Edmund, who was holding open the door, said, as she passed
            him, </span>
          <span id="said_no_02808" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"You must dance with me, Fanny; you must
            keep two dances for me; any two that you like, except the first."</span>
          <span id="said_no_02809" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> She had nothing more to wish for. She
            had hardly ever been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her life.Her
            cousins' former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to her;</span>
          <span id="said_no_02810" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she felt it to be</span>

          <span id="said_no_02813" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and was actually practising her steps
            about the drawing-room as long as she could be safe from the notice of her aunt Norris,
            who was entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring the noble fire which
            the butler had prepared.</span></p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02814" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Half an hour followed that would have
            been at least languid under any other circumstances, but Fanny's happiness still
            prevailed. It was but to think of her conversation with Edmund, and what was the
            restlessness of Mrs. Norris? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02815" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The gentlemen joined them; and soon
            after began the sweet expectation of a carriage, when a general spirit of ease and
            enjoyment seemed diffused, and they all stood about and talked and laughed, and every
            moment had its pleasure and its hope. Fanny felt that there must be a struggle in
            Edmund's cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the effort so successfully
            made.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02816" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">When the carriages were really heard,
            when the guests began really to assemble, her own gaiety of heart was much subdued: the
            sight of so many strangers threw her back into herself; and besides the gravity and
            formality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither Sir Thomas nor Lady
            Bertram were of a kind to do away, she found herself occasionally called on to endure
            something worse. She was introduced here and there by her uncle, and forced to be spoken
            to, and to curtsey, and speak again. This was a hard duty, and she was never summoned to
            it without looking at William, as he walked about at his ease in the background of the
            scene, and longing to be with him.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02817" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The entrance of the Grants and
            Crawfords was a favourable epoch. The stiffness of the meeting soon gave way before
            their popular manners and more diffused intimacies: little groups were formed, and
            everybody grew comfortable. Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils
            of civility, would have been again most happy, could she have kept her eyes from
            wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02818" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            
            <em>She</em> looked all loveliness—and what might not be the end of
            it?</span>
          <span id="said_no_02819" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her own musings were brought to an end
            on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, and her thoughts were put into another channel by
            his engaging her almost instantly for the first two dances. Her happiness on this
            occasion was very much <em>a</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>mortal</em>, finely chequered. To be secure of a partner at first was
            a most essential good—for the moment of beginning was now growing seriously near;
            and</span>
          <span id="said_no_02820" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she</span>
          <span id="said_no_02821" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">so little understood her own claims
            as</span>
          <span id="said_no_02822" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">to think that</span>
          <span id="said_no_02823" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            if Mr. Crawford had not
            asked her, she must have been the last to be sought after, and should have received a
            partner only through a series of inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would have
            been terrible;</span>
          <span id="said_no_02824" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">but at the same time there was a
            pointedness in his manner of asking her which she did not like, and she saw his eye
            glancing for a moment at her necklace, with a smile— she thought there was a smile
            —which made her blush and feel wretched. And though there was no second glance to
            disturb her, though his object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable, she could not
            get the better of her embarrassment, heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving
            it, and had no composure till he turned away to some one else. Then she could gradually
            rise up to the genuine satisfaction of </span>
          <span id="said_no_02825" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            having a partner, a
            voluntary partner, secured against the dancing began.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02826" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">When the company were moving into the
            ballroom, she found herself for the first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles
            were immediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother's had been, and who was
            beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxious to get the story over, hastened
            to give the explanation of the second necklace: the real chain. Miss Crawford listened;
            and all her intended compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she felt only
            one thing; and her eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could yet be
            brighter, she exclaimed with eager pleasure, "Did he? Did Edmund? That was like himself.
            No other man would have thought of it. I honour him beyond expression." And she looked
            around as if longing to tell him so. He was not near, he was attending a party of ladies
            out of the room; and Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm of each,
            they followed with the rest.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02827" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny's heart sunk, but there was no
            leisure for thinking long even of Miss Crawford's feelings. They were in the ballroom,
            the violins were playing, and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on
            anything serious. She must watch the general arrangements, and see how everything was
            done.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02828" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to
            her, and asked if she were engaged; and the </span>
          <span id="said_no_02829" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,"</span>
          <span id="said_no_02830" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">was exactly what he had intended to
            hear. Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her, saying something
            which discovered to Fanny, that</span>
          <span id="said_no_02831" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            
            <em>she</em> was to lead the way and open the ball;</span>
          <span id="said_no_02832" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">an idea that had never occurred to her
            before. Whenever she had thought of the minutiae of the evening, it had been as a matter
            of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford; and the impression was so strong,
            that though <em>her</em>
            <em>uncle</em> spoke the contrary, she could not help an exclamation of
            surprise, a hint of her unfitness, an entreaty even to be excused. To be urging her
            opinion against Sir Thomas's was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her
            horror at the first suggestion, that</span>
          <span id="said_no_02833" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could actually look him in the
            face and say</span>
          <span id="said_no_02834" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
             that she hoped it might
            be settled otherwise;</span>
          <span id="said_no_02835" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">in vain, however: Sir Thomas smiled,
            tried to encourage her, and then looked too serious, and said too decidedly, </span>
          <span id="said_no_02836" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sir Thomas Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"It must be so, my dear,"</span>
          <span id="said_no_02837" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">for her to hazard another word; and
            she found herself the next moment conducted by Mr. Crawford to the top of the room, and
            standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers, couple after couple, as they
            were formed.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02838" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She could hardly believe it.</span>

            To be placed above so
            many elegant young women! The distinction was too great. It was treating her like her

            they were not at home to

            to what they had all
            been to each other when once dancing in that house before,</span>
          <span id="said_no_02850" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">the present arrangement was almost

          <span id="said_no_02851" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The ball began. It was rather honour
            than happiness to Fanny, for the first dance at least: her partner was in excellent
            spirits, and tried to impart them to her; but she was a great deal too much frightened
            to have any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at. Young, pretty,
            and gentle, however, she had no awkwardnesses that were not as good as graces, and there
            were few persons present that were not disposed to praise her. She was attractive, she
            was modest, she was Sir Thomas's niece, and she was soon said to be admired by Mr.
            Crawford. It was enough to give her general favour. Sir Thomas himself was watching her
            progress down the dance with much complacency; he was proud of his niece; and without
            attributing all her personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris seemed to do, to her transplantation
            to Mansfield, he was pleased with himself for having supplied everything else:</span>
          <span id="said_no_02852" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            education and manners she

          <span id="said_no_02853" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas's
            thoughts as he stood, and having, in spite of all his wrongs towards her, a general
            prevailing desire of recommending herself to him, took an opportunity of stepping aside
            to say something agreeable of Fanny. Her praise was warm, and he received it as she
            could wish, joining in it as far as discretion, and politeness, and slowness of speech
            would allow, and certainly appearing to greater advantage on the subject than his lady
            did soon afterwards, when Mary, perceiving her on a sofa very near, turned round before
            she began to dance, to compliment her on Miss Price's looks.</span>

            have Fanny admired; but she was so much more struck with her own kindness in sending
            Chapman to her, that she could not get it out of her head.</span>

          <span id="said_no_02858" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too
            well to think of gratifying <em>her</em> by commendation of Fanny; to her,
            it was as the occasion offered— "Ah! ma'am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and
            Julia to-night!" and Mrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she
            had time for, amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up card-tables,
            giving hints to Sir Thomas, and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the

            Fanny herself in her intentions to please. She meant to be giving her little heart a
            happy flutter, and filling her with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and,
            misinterpreting Fanny's blushes, still thought she must be doing so when she went to her
            after the two first dances, and said, with a significant look,"</span>

            tell me why my brother goes to town to-morrow? He says he has business there, but will

            all come to. All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply to you for
            information. Pray, what is Henry going for?"</span></p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02861" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny protested her ignorance as

            <span id="said_no_02862" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Well, then,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_02863" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">replied Miss Crawford, laughing, </span>
            <span id="said_no_02864" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"I must suppose it to be purely for
              the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of you by the way."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02865" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny was confused, but it was the
            confusion of discontent; while Miss Crawford wondered she did not smile, and thought her
            over-anxious, or thought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible of
            pleasure in Henry's attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the course of the
            evening; but Henry's attentions had very little to do with it.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02866" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She would</span>

            much rather <em>not</em> have been asked by him again so very soon,</span>
          <span id="said_no_02868" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>
          <span id="said_no_02869" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she wished</span>
          <span id="said_no_02870" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            she had not been obliged
            to suspect that his previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all
            for the sake of securing her at that part of the evening.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02871" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            But it was not to be
            avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she could not say that
            it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner; and
            sometimes, when he talked of William, he was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a
            warmth of heart which did him credit.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02872" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">But still his attentions made no part
            of her satisfaction. She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw how perfectly
            he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she could walk about with him and
            hear his account of his partners; she was happy in knowing herself admired; and she was
            happy in having the two dances with Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest
            part of the evening, her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite
            engagement with <em>him</em> was in continual perspective. She was happy
            even when they did take place; but not from any flow of spirits on his side, or any such
            expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning. His mind was fagged, and her
            happiness sprung from being the friend with whom it could find repose. "I am worn out
            with civility," said he. "I have been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to
            say. But with <em>you</em>, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not want
            to be talked to. Let us have the luxury of silence." Fanny would hardly even speak her
            agreement. A weariness, arising probably, in great measure, from the same feelings which
            he had acknowledged in the morning, was peculiarly to be respected, and they went down
            their two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on
            that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02873" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The evening had afforded Edmund little
            pleasure. Miss Crawford had been in gay spirits when they first danced together, but it
            was not her gaiety that could do him good: it rather sank than raised his comfort; and
            afterwards, for he found himself still impelled to seek her again, she had absolutely
            pained him by her manner of speaking of the profession to which he was now on the point
            of belonging. They had talked, and they had been silent; he had reasoned, she had
            ridiculed; and they had parted at last with mutual vexation. Fanny, not able to refrain
            entirely from observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02874" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            It was barbarous to be
            happy when Edmund was suffering.</span>
          <span id="said_no_02875" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Yet some happiness must and would
            arise from the very conviction that he did suffer.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_02876" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">When her two dances with him were
            over, her inclination and strength for more were pretty well at an end; and Sir Thomas,
            having seen her walk rather than dance down the shortening set, breathless, and with her
            hand at her side, gave his orders for her sitting down entirely. From that time Mr.
            Crawford sat down likewise.</span>

            indulgence. But though her wishes were overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring
            within her. On the contrary, she was so totally unused to have her pleasure consulted,
            or to have anything take place at all in the way she could desire, that she was more
