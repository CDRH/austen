            was to see his father alone, and give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme,
            defending his own share in it as far only as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel
            his motives to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, that his
            concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his judgment in it very
            doubtful. He was anxious, while vindicating himself, to say nothing unkind of the
            others: but there was only one amongst them whose conduct he could mention without some
            necessity of defence or palliation. </span>

            such a scheme among such a party, and at such a time, as strongly as his son had ever
            supposed he must; he felt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands
            with Edmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and forget how much he
            had been forgotten himself as soon as he could, after the house had been cleared of
            every object enforcing the remembrance, and restored to its proper state. He did not
            enter into any remonstrance with his other children: he was more willing to believe they
            felt their error than to run the risk of investigation.</span>

            The young people had been
            very inconsiderate in forming the plan; they ought to have been capable of a better
            decision themselves; but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of
            unsteady characters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he must regard her
            acquiescence in their wrong measures, her countenance of their unsafe amusements, than
            that such measures and such amusements should have been suggested.</span>
          <span id="said_no_01892" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Norris was a little confounded
            and as nearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she was ashamed to
            confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was so glaring to Sir Thomas, and
            would not have admitted that her influence was insufficient— that she might have talked
            in vain. Her only resource was to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn
            the current of Sir Thomas's ideas into a happier channel. She had a great deal to
            insinuate in her own praise as to <em>general</em> attention to the
            interest and comfort of his family, much exertion and many sacrifices to glance at in
            the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from her own fireside, and many excellent
            hints of distrust and economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most
            considerable saving had always arisen, and more than one bad servant been detected. But
            her chief strength lay in Sotherton. Her greatest support and glory was in having formed
            the connexion with the Rushworths. <em>There</em> she was impregnable. She
            took to herself all the credit of bringing Mr. Rushworth's admiration of Maria to any
            effect. </span>

              introduced to his mother, and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit, I am
              as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it; for Mr. Rushworth is the
              sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement, and there
              were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle. But I left no stone
              unturned. I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister, and at last I
              did persuade her. You know the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle of winter,
              and the roads almost impassable, but I did persuade her."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01897" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Norris" data-placement="auto top">"My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen
            the state of the roads <em>that</em> day! I thought we should never have
            got through them, though we had the four horses of course; and poor old coachman would
            attend us, out of his great love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box
            on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas. I
            cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter—and this was such a day, I could
            not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture: he
            was putting on his wig; so I said, 'Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and
            I shall be very safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has been upon the
            leaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.' But, however, I soon found it
            would not do; he was bent upon going, and as I hate to be worrying and officious, I said
            no more; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got into the rough
            lanes about Stoke, where, what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it was worse
            than anything you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about him. And then the poor
            horses too! To see them straining away! You know how I always feel for the horses. And
            when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do you think I did? You will laugh at
            me; but I got out and walked up. I did indeed. It might not be saving them much, but it
            was something, and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense
            of those noble animals. I caught a dreadful cold, but <em>that</em> I did
            not regard. My object was accomplished in the visit."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01898" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sir Thomas Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I hope we shall always think the
            acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it. There is nothing
            very striking in Mr. Rushworth's manners, but I was pleased last night with what
            appeared to be his opinion on one subject: his decided preference of a quiet family
            party to the bustle and confusion of acting. He seemed to feel exactly as one could
            wish."</span>

            him the better you will like him. He is not a shining character, but he has a thousand
            good qualities; and is so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about
            it, for everybody considers it as my doing.</span>

            Conversation with any of them occupied but a small part of it. He had to reinstate
            himself in all the wonted concerns of his Mansfield life: to see his steward and his
            bailiff; to examine and compute, and, in the intervals of business, to walk into his
            stables and his gardens, and nearest plantations; but active and methodical, he had not
            only done all this before he resumed his seat as master of the house at dinner, he had
            also set the carpenter to work in pulling down what had been so lately put up in the
            billiard-room, and given the scene-painter his dismissal long enough to justify the
            pleasing belief</span>

          <span id="said_no_01919" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He believed this very stoutly while he
            was in Mansfield Wood, and all the way home; but there was a something in Sir Thomas,
            when they sat round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think it wiser to let him
            pursue his own way, and feel the folly of it without opposition.</span>

            He had known many
            disagreeable fathers before, and often been struck with the inconveniences they
            occasioned, but never, in the whole course of his life, had he seen one of that class so
            unintelligibly moral, so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas. He was not a man to be
            endured but for his children's sake, and he might be thankful to his fair daughter Julia
            that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof.</span>

            smoothness, though almost every mind was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called
            for from his daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony. Maria was in a good
            deal of agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her that Crawford should now lose
            no time in declaring himself, and she was disturbed that even a day should be gone by
            without seeming to advance that point. She had been expecting to see him the whole
            morning, and all the evening, too, was still expecting him. Mr. Rushworth had set off
            early with the great news for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped for such an immediate
              <em>eclaircissement</em> as might save him the trouble of ever coming
            back again. But they had seen no one from the Parsonage, not a creature, and had heard
            no tidings beyond a friendly note of congratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady
            Bertram. It was the first day for many, many weeks, in which the families had been
            wholly divided. Four-and-twenty hours had never passed before, since August began,
            without bringing them together in some way or other. It was a sad, anxious day; and the
            morrow, though differing in the sort of evil, did by no means bring less. A few moments
            of feverish enjoyment were followed by hours of acute suffering. Henry Crawford was
            again in the house: he walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respects to
            Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the breakfast-room, where
            were most of the family. Sir Thomas soon appeared, and Maria saw with delight and
            agitation the introduction of the man she loved to her father. Her sensations were
            indefinable, and so were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing</span>

          <span id="said_no_01934" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">(looking significantly at his

            and very little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew how <em>that</em> would be from the first. It is early for Bath. You will find nobody

            Bath?"</span> was the next question; and while this branch of the subject was under
          discussion, Maria, who wanted neither pride nor resolution, was preparing to encounter her
          share of it with tolerable calmness.</p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_01940" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">To her he soon turned, repeating much
            of what he had already said, with only a softened air and stronger expressions of
            regret. But what availed his expressions or his air?</span>

            He was going, and, if not
            voluntarily going, voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting what might be due
            to his uncle, his engagements were all self-imposed. He might talk of necessity, but she
            knew his independence. The hand which had so pressed hers to his heart! the hand and the
            heart were alike motionless and passive now!</span>
          <span id="said_no_01942" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her spirit supported her, but the
            agony of her mind was severe. She had not long to endure what arose from listening to
            language which his actions contradicted, or to bury the tumult of her feelings under the
            restraint of society; for general civilities soon called his notice from her, and the
            farewell visit, as it then became openly acknowledged, was a very short one.</span>

            He was gone— he had
            touched her hand for the last time, he had made his parting bow,</span>
          <span id="said_no_01944" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and she might seek directly all that
            solitude could do for her. Henry Crawford was gone, gone from the house, and within two
            hours afterwards from the parish; and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had
            raised in Maria and Julia Bertram.</span>

          <span id="said_no_01945" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Julia could rejoice that he was gone.
            His presence was beginning to be odious to her; and if Maria gained him not, she was now
            cool enough to dispense with any other revenge. She did not want exposure to be added to
            desertion. Henry Crawford gone, she could even pity her sister.</span>

            gone likewise. In <em>his</em> departure Sir Thomas felt the chief
            interest: wanting to be alone with his family, the presence of a stranger superior to
            Mr. Yates must have been irksome; but of him, trifling and confident, idle and
            expensive, it was every way vexatious. In himself he was wearisome, but as the friend of
            Tom and the admirer of Julia he became offensive. Sir Thomas had been quite indifferent
            to Mr. Crawford's going or staying: but his good wishes for Mr. Yates's having a
            pleasant journey, as he walked with him to the hall-door, were given with genuine
            satisfaction. Mr. Yates had staid to see the destruction of every theatrical preparation
            at Mansfield, the removal of everything appertaining to the play: he left the house in
            all the soberness of its general character; and Sir Thomas hoped, in seeing him out of
            it, to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme, and the last that must be
            inevitably reminding him of its existence.</span>
