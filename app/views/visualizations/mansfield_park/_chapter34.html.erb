        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03481" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edmund had great things to hear on his
            return. Many surprises were awaiting him. The first that occurred was not least in
            interest: the appearance of Henry Crawford and his sister walking together through the
            village as he rode into it.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03482" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            He had concluded —he had
            meant them to be far distant. His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely
            to avoid Miss Crawford.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03483" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He was returning to Mansfield with
            spirits ready to feed on melancholy remembrances, and tender associations, when her own
            fair self was before him, leaning on her brother's arm, and he found himself receiving a
            welcome, unquestionably friendly, from the woman whom, two moments before, he had been
            thinking of as seventy miles off, and as farther, much farther, from him in inclination
            than any distance could express.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03484" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her reception of him was of a sort
            which he could not have hoped for, had he expected to see her. Coming as he did from
            such a purport fulfilled as had taken him away, he would have expected anything rather
            than a look of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning. It was enough to set
            his heart in a glow, and to bring him home in the properest state for feeling the full
            value of the other joyful surprises at hand.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03485" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">William's promotion, with all its
            particulars, he was soon master of; and with such a secret provision of comfort within
            his own breast to help the joy, he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and
            unvarying cheerfulness all dinner-time.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03486" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">After dinner, when he and his father
            were alone, he had Fanny's history; and then all the great events of the last fortnight,
            and the present situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03487" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny suspected what was going
            on.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03488" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            They sat so much longer
            than usual in the dining-parlour, that she was sure they must be talking of her;</span>
          <span id="said_no_03489" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and when tea at last brought them
            away, and she was to be seen by Edmund again, she felt dreadfully guilty. He came to
            her, sat down by her, took her hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment she
            thought that, but for the occupation and the scene which the tea-things afforded, she
            must have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable excess.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03490" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He was not intending, however, by such
            action, to be conveying to her that unqualified approbation and encouragement which her
            hopes drew from it. It was designed only to express his participation in all that
            interested her, and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened every feeling of
            affection. He was, in fact, entirely on his father's side of the question. His surprise
            was not so great as his father's at her refusing Crawford, because, so far from
            supposing her to consider him with anything like a preference, he had always believed it
            to be rather the reverse, and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared, but
            Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more desirable than he did. It had every
            recommendation to him; and while honouring her for what she had done under the influence
            of her present indifference, honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas
            could quite echo,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03491" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he was most earnest in</span>
          <span id="said_no_03492" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            hoping, and</span>
          <span id="said_no_03493" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">sanguine in</span>
          <span id="said_no_03494" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            believing, that it would be
            a match at last, and</span>
          <span id="said_no_03495" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">that,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03496" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            united by mutual affection,
            it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in
            each other,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03497" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">as he was now beginning seriously to
            consider them.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03498" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            Crawford had been too
            precipitate. He had not given her time to attach herself. He had begun at the wrong end.
            With such powers as his, however, and such a disposition as hers, Edmund trusted that
            everything would work out a happy conclusion.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03499" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Meanwhile, he saw enough of Fanny's
            embarrassment to make him scrupulously guard against exciting it a second time, by any
            word, or look, or movement.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03500" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Crawford called the next day, and on
            the score of Edmund's return,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03501" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas felt himself more than
            licensed to ask him</span>
          <span id="said_no_03502" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            to stay dinner;</span>
          <span id="said_no_03503" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">it was really a necessary compliment.
            He staid of course, and Edmund had then ample opportunity for observing how he sped with
            Fanny, and what degree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her
            manners; and it was so little, so very, very little —every chance, every possibility of
            it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there was not hope in her confusion, there
            was hope in nothing else —that he was almost ready to wonder at his friend's
            perseverance.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03504" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            Fanny was worth it
            all;</span>
          <span id="said_no_03505" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">he held her to be</span>
          <span id="said_no_03506" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ed" data-placement="auto top">
            worth every effort of
            patience, every exertion of mind, but he did not think he could have gone on himself
            with any woman breathing, without something more to warm his courage than his eyes could
            discern in hers.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03507" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He was very willing to hope that
            Crawford saw clearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friend that
            he could come to from all that he observed to pass before, and at, and after
            dinner.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03508" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">In the evening a few circumstances
            occurred which he thought more promising. When he and Crawford walked into the
            drawing-room, his mother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if
            there were nothing else to care for. Edmund could not help noticing their apparently
            deep tranquillity.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03509" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"We have not been so silent all the
              time,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_03510" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">replied his mother. </span>
            <span id="said_no_03511" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Fanny has been reading to me, and
              only put the book down upon hearing you coming."</span>
            <span id="said_no_03512" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">And sure enough there was a book on
              the table which had the air of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. </span>
            <span id="said_no_03513" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"She often reads to me out of those
              books; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man's— what's his name,
              Fanny?— when we heard your footsteps."</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03514" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Crawford took the volume. </span>
          
            <span id="said_no_03515" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"Let me have the pleasure of
              finishing that speech to your ladyship,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_03516" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">said he. </span>
            <span id="said_no_03517" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"I shall find it
              immediately."</span>
            <span id="said_no_03518" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">And by carefully giving way to the
              inclination of the leaves, he did find it, or within a page or two, quite near enough
              to satisfy</span>
            <span id="said_no_03519" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lady Bertram, who assured
              him,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03520" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">as soon as he mentioned the name of
              Cardinal Wolsey,</span>
            <span id="said_no_03521" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">that</span>
            <span id="said_no_03522" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_ladyb" data-placement="auto top">
              he had got the very
              speech.</span>
            <span id="said_no_03523" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Not a look or an offer of help had
              Fanny given; not a syllable for or against. All her attention was for her work. She
              seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But taste was too strong in her.
              She could not abstract her mind five minutes: she was forced to listen; his reading
              was capital, and her pleasure in good reading extreme. To <em>good</em>
              reading, however, she had been long used: her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund
              very well, but in Mr. Crawford's reading there was a variety of excellence beyond what
              she had ever met with. The King, the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey, Cromwell, all were
              given in turn; for with the happiest knack, the happiest power of jumping and
              guessing, he could always alight at will on the best scene, or the best speeches of
              each; and whether it were dignity, or pride, or tenderness, or remorse, or whatever
              were to be expressed, he could do it with equal beauty. It was truly dramatic. His
              acting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play might give, and his reading brought
              all his acting before her again; nay, perhaps with greater enjoyment, for it came
              unexpectedly, and with no such drawback as she had been used to suffer in seeing him
              on the stage with Miss Bertram.</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03524" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Edmund watched the progress of her
            attention, and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the
            needlework, which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally: how it fell from her
            hand while she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes which had appeared so
            studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford— fixed on
            him for minutes, fixed on him, in short, till the attraction drew Crawford's upon her,
            and the book was closed, and the charm was broken. Then she was shrinking again into
            herself, and blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been enough to give Edmund
            encouragement for his friend, and as he cordially thanked him, he hoped to be expressing
            Fanny's secret feelings too.</span>
        </p>

            <span id="said_no_03525" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Edmund Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"That play must be a favourite with
              you,"</span>

            <span id="said_no_03529" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top"> replied Crawford;</span>
            <span id="said_no_03530" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"but I do not think I have had a
              volume of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen. I once saw Henry the
              Eighth acted, or I have heard of it from somebody who did, I am not certain which. But
              Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part of an
              Englishman's constitution. His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one
              touches them everywhere; one is intimate with him by instinct. No man of any brain can
              open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning
              immediately."</span>

              celebrated passages are quoted by everybody; they are in half the books we open, and
              we all talk Shakespeare, use his similes, and describe with his descriptions; but this
              is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it. To know him in bits and
              scraps is common enough; to know him pretty thoroughly is, perhaps, not uncommon; but
              to read him well aloud is no everyday talent."</span>

              improvement abroad; but among those who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago,
              the larger number, to judge by their performance, must have thought reading was
              reading, and preaching was preaching. It is different now. The subject is more justly
              considered. It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending
              the most solid truths; and besides, there is more general observation and taste, a
              more critical knowledge diffused than formerly; in every congregation there is a
              larger proportion who know a little of the matter, and who can judge and

            There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is
            entitled to the highest praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and affect such an

            speak at any rate, was determined to keep it up; and poor Fanny, who had hoped to
            silence him by such an extremity of reproof, found herself sadly mistaken, and that it
            was only a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another. He had
            always something to entreat the explanation of. The opportunity was too fair. None such
            had occurred since his seeing her in her uncle's room, none such might occur again
            before his leaving Mansfield. Lady Bertram's being just on the other side of the table
            was a trifle, for she might always be considered as only half-awake, and Edmund's
            advertisements were still of the first utility.</span>

              now understand more clearly your opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed
              by the whim of the moment, easily tempted, easily put aside. With such an opinion, no
              wonder that. But we shall see. It is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to
              convince you I am wronged; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady. My
              conduct shall speak for me; absence, distance, time shall speak for me. <em>They</em> shall prove that, as far as you can be deserved by anybody,
              I do deserve you. You are infinitely my superior in merit; all <em>that</em> I know. You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in
              such a degree in any human creature. You have some touches of the angel in you beyond
              what— not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees anything like it— but
              beyond what one fancies might be. But still I am not frightened. It is not by equality
              of merit that you can be won. That is out of the question. It is he who sees and
              worships your merit the strongest, who loves you most devotedly, that has the best
              right to a return. There I build my confidence. By that right I do and will deserve
              you; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it, I know you too
              well not to entertain the warmest hopes. Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay"</span>

              no right; but by what other name can I call you? Do you suppose you are ever present
              to my imagination under any other? No, it is 'Fanny' that I think of all day, and
              dream of all night. You have given the name such reality of sweetness, that nothing
              else can now be descriptive of you."</span>

            public opposition she foresaw to it, had it not been for the sound of approaching
            relief, the very sound which she had been long watching for, and long thinking strangely
