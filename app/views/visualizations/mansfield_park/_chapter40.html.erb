            expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now at the rapid rate in which their correspondence
            had begun; Mary's next letter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last, but
            she was not right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great relief to
            herself. Here was another strange revolution of mind! She was really glad to receive the
            letter when it did come. In her present exile from good society, and distance from
            everything that had been wont to interest her, a letter from one belonging to the set
            where her heart lived, written with affection, and some degree of elegance, was
            thoroughly acceptable. The usual plea of increasing engagements was made in excuse for
            not having written to her earlier; </span>

                for Henry is in Norfolk; business called him to Everingham ten days ago, or perhaps
                he only pretended to call, for the sake of being travelling at the same time that
                you were. But there he is, and, by the bye, his absence may sufficiently account for
                any remissness of his sister's in writing, for there has been no</span>

                'Well, Mary, when
                do you write to Fanny? Is not it time for you to write to Fanny?'</span>
              <span id="said_no_04094" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Crawford" data-placement="auto top">to spur me on. At last, after
                various attempts at meeting, I have seen your cousins, 'dear Julia and dearest Mrs.
                Rushworth'; they found me at home yesterday, and we were glad to see each other
                again. We <em>seemed</em>
                <em>very</em> glad to see each other, and I do really think we were a
                little. We had a vast deal to say. Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when
                your name was mentioned? I did not use to think her wanting in self-possession, but
                she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday. Upon the whole, Julia was in
                the best looks of the two, at least after you were spoken of. There was no
                recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of 'Fanny,' and spoke of her
                as a sister should. But Mrs. Rushworth's day of good looks will come; we have cards
                for her first party on the 28th. Then she will be in beauty, for she will open one
                of the best houses in Wimpole Street. I was in it two years ago, when it was Lady
                Lascelle's, and prefer it to almost any I know in London, and certainly she will
                then feel, to use a vulgar phrase, that she has got her pennyworth for her penny.
                Henry could not have afforded her such a house. I hope she will recollect it, and be
                satisfied, as well as she may, with moving the queen of a palace, though the king
                may appear best in the background; and as I have no desire to tease her, I shall
                never <em>force</em> your name upon her again. She will grow sober by
                degrees. From all that I hear and guess, Baron Wildenheim's attentions to Julia
                continue, but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement. She ought to do
                better. A poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot imagine any liking in the case,
                for take away his rants, and the poor baron has nothing. What a difference a vowel
                makes! If his rents were but equal to his rants! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly;
                detained, perchance, by parish duties. There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey
                to be converted. I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a <em>young</em> one. Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London:
                write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry's eyes, when he comes back, and send
                me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his
                sake."</span>

          <span id="said_no_04095" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was great food for meditation in
            this letter, and chiefly for unpleasant meditation; and yet, with all the uneasiness it
            supplied, it connected her with the absent, it told her of people and things about whom
            she had never felt so much curiosity as now, and she would have been glad to have been
            sure of such a letter every week. Her correspondence with her aunt Bertram was her only
            concern of higher interest.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04096" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">As for any society in Portsmouth, that
            could at all make amends for deficiencies at home, there were none within the circle of
            her father's and mother's acquaintance to afford her the smallest satisfaction: she saw
            nobody in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own shyness and reserve. The men
            appeared to her all coarse, the women all pert, everybody underbred; and she gave as
            little contentment as she received from introductions either to old or new acquaintance.
            The young ladies who approached her at first with some respect, in consideration of her
            coming from a baronet's family, were soon offended by what they termed "airs"; for, as
            she neither played on the pianoforte nor wore fine pelisses, they could, on farther
            observation, admit no right of superiority.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04097" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The first solid consolation which
            Fanny received for the evils of home, the first which her judgment could entirely
            approve, and which gave any promise of durability, was in a better knowledge of Susan,
            and a hope of being of service to her. Susan had always behaved pleasantly to herself,
            but the determined character of her general manners had astonished and alarmed her, and
            it was at least a fortnight before she began to understand a disposition so totally
            different from her own. Susan saw that much was wrong at home, and wanted to set it
            right. That a girl of fourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason, should err in
            the method of reform, was not wonderful; and Fanny soon became more disposed to admire
            the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguish justly, than to censure
            severely the faults of conduct to which it led. Susan was only acting on the same
            truths, and pursuing the same system, which her own judgment acknowledged, but which her
            more supine and yielding temper would have shrunk from asserting.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04098" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            Susan tried to be
            useful, where <em>she</em> could only have gone away and cried; and that
            Susan was useful</span>
          <span id="said_no_04099" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she could perceive;</span>
          <span id="said_no_04100" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            that things, bad as they
            were, would have been worse but for such interposition, and that both her mother and
            Betsey were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgence and
            vulgarity.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04101" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            In every argument with
            her mother, Susan had in point of reason the advantage, and never was there any maternal
            tenderness to buy her off. The blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around
            her she had never known. There was no gratitude for affection past or present to make
            her better bear with its excesses to the others.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04102" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">All this became gradually evident, and
            gradually placed Susan before her sister as an object of mingled compassion and
            respect.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04103" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            That her manner was
            wrong, however, at times very wrong, her measures often ill-chosen and ill-timed, and
            her looks and language very often indefensible,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04104" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny could not cease to feel; but she
            began to hope they might be rectified. Susan, she found, looked up to her and wished for
            her good opinion; and new as anything like an office of authority was to Fanny, new as
            it was to imagine herself capable of guiding or informing any one, she did resolve to
            give occasional hints to Susan, and endeavour to exercise for her advantage the juster
            notions of what was due to everybody, and what would be wisest for herself, which her
            own more favoured education had fixed in her.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04105" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her influence, or at least the
            consciousness and use of it, originated in an act of kindness by Susan, which, after
            many hesitations of delicacy, she at last worked herself up to. It had very early
            occurred to her that a small sum of money might, perhaps, restore peace for ever on the
            sore subject of the silver knife, canvassed as it now was continually, and the riches
            which she was in possession of herself, her uncle having given her 10 at parting, made
            her as able as she was willing to be generous. But she was so wholly unused to confer
            favours, except on the very poor, so unpractised in removing evils, or bestowing
            kindnesses among her equals, and so fearful of appearing to elevate herself as a great
            lady at home, that it took some time to determine that it would not be unbecoming in her
            to make such a present. It was made, however, at last: a silver knife was bought for
            Betsey, and accepted with great delight, its newness giving it every advantage over the
            other that could be desired; Susan was established in the full possession of her
            own,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04106" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Betsey handsomely declaring
            that</span>
          <span id="said_no_04107" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_9" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_betsey" data-placement="auto top">
            now she had got one so
            much prettier herself, she should never want <em>that</em> again;</span>
          <span id="said_no_04108" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and no reproach seemed conveyed to the
            equally satisfied mother, which Fanny had almost feared to be impossible. The deed
            thoroughly answered: a source of domestic altercation was entirely done away, and it was
            the means of opening Susan's heart to her, and giving her something more to love and be
            interested in. Susan shewed that she had delicacy: pleased as she was to be mistress of
            property which she had been struggling for at least two years,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04109" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she yet feared that</span>
          <span id="said_no_04110" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_susan" data-placement="auto top">
            her sister's judgment
            had been against her, and</span>
          <span id="said_no_04111" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">that</span>
          <span id="said_no_04112" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_susan" data-placement="auto top">
            a reproof was designed
            her for having so struggled as to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of
            the house.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04113" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her temper was open. She acknowledged
            her fears, blamed herself for having contended so warmly; and from that hour Fanny,
            understanding the worth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to
            seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment, began to feel again the blessing of
            affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in need of help,
            and so much deserving it. She gave advice, advice too sound to be resisted by a good
            understanding, and given so mildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect
            temper, and she had the happiness of observing its good effects not unfrequently. More
            was not expected by one who, while seeing all the obligation and expediency of
            submission and forbearance, saw also with sympathetic acuteness of feeling all that must
            be hourly grating to a girl like Susan. Her greatest wonder on the subject soon
            became—not that Susan should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience against
            her better knowledge—but that</span>
          <span id="said_no_04114" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            so much better
            knowledge, so many good notions should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in
            the midst of negligence and error, she should have formed such proper opinions of what
            ought to be; she, who had had no cousin Edmund to direct her thoughts or fix her
            principles.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04115" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The intimacy thus begun between them
            was a material advantage to each. By sitting together upstairs, they avoided a great
            deal of the disturbance of the house; Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think it no
            misfortune to be quietly employed. They sat without a fire; but that was a privation
            familiar even to Fanny, and she suffered the less because reminded by it of the East
            room. It was the only point of resemblance. In space, light, furniture, and prospect,
            there was nothing alike in the two apartments; and she often heaved a sigh at the
            remembrance of all her books and boxes, and various comforts there. By degrees the girls
            came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs, at first only in working and talking,
            but after a few days, the remembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative
            that Fanny found it impossible not to try for books again. There were none in her
            father's house; but wealth is luxurious and daring, and some of hers found its way to a
            circulating library. She became a subscriber; amazed at being anything <em>in propria persona</em>, amazed at her own doings in every way,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04116" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            to be a renter, a chuser
            of books! And to be having any one's improvement in view in her choice!</span>
          <span id="said_no_04117" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">But so it was. Susan had read nothing,
            and Fanny longed to give her a share in her own first pleasures, and inspire a taste for
            the biography and poetry which she delighted in herself.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04118" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">In this occupation she hoped,
            moreover, to bury some of the recollections of Mansfield, which were too apt to seize
            her mind if her fingers only were busy; and, especially at this time, hoped it might be
            useful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London, whither, on the
            authority of her aunt's last letter, she knew he was gone. She had no doubt of what
            would ensue. The promised notification was hanging over her head. The postman's knock
            within the neighbourhood was beginning to bring its daily terrors, and</span>
          <span id="said_no_04119" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            if reading could banish
            the idea for even half an hour, it was something gained.</span>
