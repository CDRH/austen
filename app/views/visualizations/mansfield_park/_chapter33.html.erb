            nor so conclusive as the lady had designed. The gentleman was not so easily satisfied.
            He had all the disposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03387" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He was in love, very much in love; and
            it was a love which, operating on an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than
            delicacy, made her affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, and
            determined him to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing her to love
            him.</span>

            He would not despair: he
            would not desist. He had every well-grounded reason for solid attachment; he knew her to
            have all the worth that could justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with
            her;</span>
          <span id="said_no_03389" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">her conduct at this very time, by
            speaking the disinterestedness and delicacy of her character (qualities which he
            believed most rare indeed), was of a sort to heighten all his wishes, and confirm all
            his resolutions. He knew not that he had a pre-engaged heart to attack. Of <em>that</em> he had no suspicion.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03390" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He considered</span>
          <span id="said_no_03391" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_henry" data-placement="auto top">her rather as one who had never
            thought on the subject enough to be in danger; who had been guarded by youth, a youth of
            mind as lovely as of person; whose modesty had prevented her from understanding his
            attentions, and who was still overpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly
            unexpected, and the novelty of a situation which her fancy had never taken into
            account.</span>

            Must it not follow of
            course, that, when he was understood, he should succeed?</span>
          <span id="said_no_03393" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He believed it fully.</span>

            Love such as his, in a
            man like himself, must with perseverance secure a return, and at no great
            distance;</span>
          <span id="said_no_03395" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and he had so much delight in the idea
            of obliging her to love him in a very short time, that her not loving him now was
            scarcely regretted. A little difficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford. He
            rather derived spirits from it. He had been apt to gain hearts too easily. His situation
            was new and animating.</span>

            much opposition all her life to find any charm in it, all this was
            unintelligible.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03397" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She found that</span>

            the subject was most

            she must entreat him
            never to mention it again, to allow her to leave him at once, and let it be considered
            as concluded for ever.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03408" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">And when farther pressed, had</span>

            in her opinion their
            dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affection incompatible; and
            that they were unfitted for each other by nature, education, and habit.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03411" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">All this she had said, and with the
            earnestness of sincerity; yet this was not enough, for</span>
          <span id="said_no_03412" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he immediately denied</span>

            there being anything
            uncongenial in their characters, or anything unfriendly in their situations; and
            positively declared, that he would still love, and still hope!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03414" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny knew her own meaning, but was no
            judge of her own manner. Her manner was incurably gentle; and she was not aware how much
            it concealed the sternness of her purpose. Her diffidence, gratitude, and softness made
            every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of self-denial; seem, at least,
            to be giving nearly as much pain to herself as to him. Mr. Crawford was no longer the
            Mr. Crawford who, as the clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram,
            had been her abhorrence, whom she had hated to see or to speak to, in whom she could
            believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of being agreeable, she had
            barely acknowledged. He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent,
            disinterested love; whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and
            upright, whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment; who was
            pouring out his sense of her merits, describing and describing again his affection,
            proving as far as words could prove it, and in the language, tone, and spirit of a man
            of talent too, that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness; and to complete
            the whole, he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William's promotion!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03415" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Here was a change, and here were
            claims which could not but operate! She might have disdained him in all the dignity of
            angry virtue, in the grounds of Sotherton, or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but he
            approached her now with rights that demanded different treatment.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03416" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            She must be courteous,
            and she must be compassionate.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03417" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">She must have a sensation of being
            honoured, and whether thinking of herself or her brother, she must have a strong feeling
            of gratitude. The effect of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated, and words
            intermingled with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper
            of vanity and hope like Crawford's, the truth, or at least the strength of her
            indifference, might well be questionable; and he was not so irrational as Fanny
            considered him, in the professions of persevering, assiduous, and not desponding
            attachment which closed the interview.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03418" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was with reluctance that he
            suffered her to go; but there was no look of despair in parting to belie his words, or
            give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he professed himself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03419" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Now she was angry.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03420" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Some resentment did arise at</span>
          <span id="said_no_03421" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_8" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            a perseverance so
            selfish and ungenerous. Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others which
            had formerly so struck and disgusted her. Here was again a something of the same Mr.
            Crawford whom she had so reprobated before. How evidently was there a gross want of
            feeling and humanity where his own pleasure was concerned; and alas! how always known no
            principle to supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in! Had her own affections
            been as free as perhaps they ought to have been, he never could have engaged
            them.</span>

          <span id="said_no_03422" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">So thought Fanny,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03423" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">in good truth and sober sadness, as

            wondering at what was yet to come, and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear

          <span id="said_no_03429" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas was obliged, or obliged
            himself, to wait till the morrow for a knowledge of what had passed between the young
            people. He then saw Mr. Crawford, and received his account. The first feeling was
            disappointment: he had hoped better things; he had thought that an hour's entreaty from
            a young man like Crawford could not have worked so little change on a gentle-tempered
            girl like Fanny; but there was speedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine
            perseverance of the lover; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal,
            Sir Thomas was soon able to depend on it himself.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03430" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Nothing was omitted, on his side, of
            civility, compliment, or kindness, that might assist the plan. Mr. Crawford's steadiness
            was honoured, and Fanny was praised, and the connexion was still the most desirable in
            the world.</span>

            At Mansfield Park Mr.
            Crawford would always be welcome; he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings
            as to the frequency of his visits, at present or in future. In all his niece's family
            and friends, there could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the influence of
            all who loved her must incline one way.</span>

            kindness might be the
            best way of working. Entreaty should be from one quarter only. The forbearance of her

            their surest means of forwarding it.</span>

            again, and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you. He is a most
            extraordinary young man, and whatever be the event, you must feel that you have created
            an attachment of no common character; though, young as you are, and little acquainted
            with the transient, varying, unsteady nature of love, as it generally exists, you cannot
            be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against
            discouragement. With him it is entirely a matter of feeling: he claims no merit in it;
            perhaps is entitled to none. Yet, having chosen so well, his constancy has a respectable
            stamp. Had his choice been less unexceptionable, I should have condemned his

              feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you. There is
              nothing more to be said or done. From this hour the subject is never to be revived
              between us. You will have nothing to fear, or to be agitated about. You cannot suppose
              me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations. Your
              happiness and advantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is required of you
              but to bear with Mr. Crawford's endeavours to convince you that they may not be
              incompatible with his. He proceeds at his own risk. You are on safe ground. I have
              engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls, as you might have done had nothing of
              this sort occurred. You will see him with the rest of us, in the same manner, and, as
              much as you can, dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant. He leaves
              Northamptonshire so soon, that even this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded.
              The future must be very uncertain. And now, my dear Fanny, this subject is closed
              between us."</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03446" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The promised departure was all that
            Fanny could think of with much satisfaction. Her uncle's kind expressions, however, and
            forbearing manner, were sensibly felt; and when</span>
          <span id="said_no_03447" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she considered</span>
          <span id="said_no_03448" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            how much of the truth
            was unknown to him, she believed she had no right to wonder at the line of conduct he
            pursued. He, who had married a daughter to Mr. Rushworth: romantic delicacy was
            certainly not to be expected from him. She must do her duty, and trust that time might
            make her duty easier than it now was.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03449" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            She could not,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03450" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">though only eighteen,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03451" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            suppose Mr. Crawford's
            attachment would hold out for ever; she could not but imagine that steady, unceasing
            discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03452" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">How much time she might, in her own
            fancy, allot for its dominion, is another concern. It would not be fair to inquire into
            a young lady's exact estimate of her own perfections.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03453" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">In spite of his intended silence, Sir
            Thomas found himself once more obliged to mention the subject to his niece, to prepare
            her briefly for its being imparted to her aunts; a measure which he would still have
            avoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally opposite feelings of
            Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding. He had no idea of concealment. It was all
            known at the Parsonage, where he loved to talk over the future with both his sisters,
            and it would be rather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress
            of his success. When Sir Thomas understood this,</span>
          <span id="said_no_03454" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he felt</span>
          <span id="said_no_03455" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            the necessity of making
            his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business without delay; though, on
            Fanny's account, he almost dreaded the effect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as
            much as Fanny herself. He deprecated her mistaken but well-meaning zeal.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03456" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas, indeed, was, by this time,
            not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those well-meaning people who are
            always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03457" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Norris, however, relieved
            him.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03458" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">He pressed</span>
          <span id="said_no_03459" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_sirt" data-placement="auto top">
            for the strictest
            forbearance and silence towards their niece;</span>
          <span id="said_no_03460" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">she not only promised, but did observe
            it. She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was: bitterly angry; but she was
            more angry with Fanny for having received such an offer than for refusing it.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03461" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_mrsn" data-placement="auto top">
            It was an injury and
            affront to Julia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford's choice;</span>
          <span id="said_no_03462" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and, independently of that, she
            disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her; and she would have grudged such an
            elevation to one whom she had been always trying to depress.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03463" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Sir Thomas gave her more credit for
            discretion on the occasion than she deserved; and Fanny could have blessed her for
            allowing her only to see her displeasure, and not to hear it.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03464" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lady Bertram took it differently. She
            had been a beauty, and a prosperous beauty, all her life; and beauty and wealth were all
            that excited her respect. To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune,
            raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion. By convincing her that Fanny <em>was</em> very pretty, which she had been doubting about before, and that
            she would be advantageously married, it made her feel a sort of credit in calling her
            niece.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03465" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Well, Fanny,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_03466" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">said she, as soon as they were alone
              together afterwards, and she really had known something like impatience to be alone
              with her, and her countenance, as she spoke, had extraordinary animation; </span>
            <span id="said_no_03467" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Well, Fanny, I have had a very
              agreeable surprise this morning. I must just speak of it <em>once</em>,
              I told Sir Thomas I must <em>once</em>,and then I shall have done. I
              give you joy, my dear niece."</span>
            <span id="said_no_03468" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">And looking at her complacently, she
              added, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03469" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"Humph, we certainly are a handsome
              family!"</span>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03470" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Fanny coloured, and doubted at first
            what to say; when, hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side, she presently
            answered—</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03471" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fanny Price" data-placement="auto top">"My dear aunt, <em>you</em> cannot wish me to do differently from what I have done, I am sure. <em>You</em> cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me, should not you?
            Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03472" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"No, my dear, I should not think of
            missing you, when such an offer as this comes in your way. I could do very well without
            you, if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford. And you must be
            aware, Fanny, that it is every young woman's duty to accept such a very unexceptionable
            offer as this."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_03473" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was almost the only rule of
            conduct, the only piece of advice, which Fanny had ever received from her aunt in the
            course of eight years and a half. It silenced her. She felt how unprofitable contention
            would be.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03474" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_fanny" data-placement="auto top">
            If her aunt's feelings
            were against her, nothing could be hoped from attacking her understanding.</span>
          <span id="said_no_03475" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Lady Bertram was quite
            talkative.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            <span id="said_no_03476" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I will tell you what,
              Fanny,"</span>
            <span id="said_no_03477" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">said she, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03478" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"I am sure he fell in love with you
              at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening. You did look remarkably
              well. Everybody said so. Sir Thomas said so. And you know you had Chapman to help you
              to dress. I am very glad I sent Chapman to you. I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure
              it was done that evening."</span>
            <span id="said_no_03479" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">And still pursuing the same cheerful
              thoughts, she soon afterwards added, </span>
            <span id="said_no_03480" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Bertram" data-placement="auto top">"And will tell you what, Fanny,
              which is more than I did for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a
