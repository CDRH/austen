          <span id="said_no_04226" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The Prices were just setting off for
            church the next day when Mr. Crawford appeared again. He came, not to stop, but to join
            them; he was asked</span>

            to go with them to the
            Garrison chapel,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04228" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">which was exactly what he had
            intended, and they all walked thither together.</span>

          <span id="said_no_04229" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The family were now seen to advantage.
            Nature had given them no inconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday dressed them
            in their cleanest skins and best attire. Sunday always brought this comfort to Fanny,
            and on this Sunday she felt it more than ever.</span>

            Her poor mother now did
            not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram's sister as she was but too apt to
            look.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04231" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">It often grieved her to the

          <span id="said_no_04233" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">the contrast between them;</span>
          <span id="said_no_04234" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">to think that</span>

            where nature had made so
            little difference, circumstances should have made so much, and</span>

            her mother, as handsome
            as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior, should have an appearance so much more worn
            and faded, so comfortless, so slatternly, so shabby.</span>
          <span id="said_no_04238" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">But Sunday made her a very creditable
            and tolerably cheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family of children,
            feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only discomposed if she saw her boys
            run into danger, or Rebecca pass by with a flower in her hat.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04239" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">In chapel they were obliged to divide,
            but Mr. Crawford took care not to be divided from the female branch; and after chapel he
            still continued with them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts.</span>

        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04240" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Mrs. Price took her weekly walk on the
            ramparts every fine Sunday throughout the year, always going directly after morning
            service and staying till dinner-time. It was her public place: there she met her
            acquaintance, heard a little news, talked over the badness of the Portsmouth servants,
            and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04241" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford
            most happy to consider the Miss Prices as his peculiar charge; and before they had been
            there long, somehow or other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have believed it,
            but he was walking between them with an arm of each under his, and she did not know how
            to prevent or put an end to it. It made her uncomfortable for a time, but yet there were
            enjoyments in the day and in the view which would be felt.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="said_no_04242" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">The day was uncommonly lovely. It was
            really March; but it was April in its mild air, brisk soft wind, and bright sun,
            occasionally clouded for a minute; and everything looked so beautiful under the
            influence of such a sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships at
            Spithead and the island beyond, with the ever-varying hues of the sea, now at high
            water, dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts with so fine a sound,
            produced altogether such a combination of charms for Fanny, as made her gradually almost
            careless of the circumstances under which she felt them. Nay, had she been without his
            arm, she would soon have known that she needed it, for she wanted strength for a two
            hours' saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally did, upon a week's previous
            inactivity. Fanny was beginning to feel the effect of being debarred from her usual
            regular exercise; she had lost ground as to health since her being in Portsmouth; and
            but for Mr. Crawford and the beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up
            now.</span>
        </p>

            view, he felt like herself. They often stopt with the same sentiment and taste, leaning
            against the wall, some minutes, to look and admire; and considering he was not Edmund,
            Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the charms of nature, and
            very well able to express his admiration. She had a few tender reveries now and then,
            which</span>
          <span id="said_no_04244" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he could sometimes take advantage of
            to look in her face without detection; and the result of these looks was, that</span>
          <span id="said_no_04245" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar_henry" data-placement="auto top">
            though as bewitching as
            ever, her face was less blooming than it ought to be. She <em>said</em>
            she was very well, and did not like to be supposed otherwise; but take it all in
            all,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04246" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">he was convinced</span>

            that her present
            residence could not be comfortable, and therefore could not be salutary for her,</span>
          <span id="said_no_04248" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.006.nar" data-placement="auto top">and he was growing anxious for her
            being again at Mansfield, where her own happiness, and his in seeing her, must be so
            much greater.</span>

            about it yet from my aunt. Perhaps I may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for
            me to be fetched exactly at the two months' end."</span>

            <span id="said_no_04259" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"I know Mansfield, I know its way,
              I know its faults towards <em>you</em>. I know the danger of your being
              so far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of
              any single being in the family. I am aware that you may be left here week after week,
              if Sir Thomas cannot settle everything for coming himself, or sending your aunt's maid
              for you, without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may
              have laid down for the next quarter of a year. This will not do. Two months is an
              ample allowance; I should think six weeks quite enough. I am considering your sister's

              be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country. If, therefore"</span>

              and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield, without waiting for the

              consequence, if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual, and

              immediately come down, and take you back to Mansfield. You know the ease and the
              pleasure with which this would be done. You know all that would be felt on the

              you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition. Indeed, you shall

              positively say, in every letter to Mary, 'I am well,' and I know you cannot speak or

            affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much, or even
            to be certain of what she ought to say. This was towards the close of their walk. He
            attended them to the last, and left them only at the door of their own house, when he
            knew them to be going to dinner, and therefore pretended to be waited for
            elsewhere.</span>

            <span id="said_no_04271" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Henry Crawford" data-placement="auto top">"I wish I left you in stronger
              health. Is there anything I can do for you in town? I have half an idea of going into
              Norfolk again soon. I am not satisfied about Maddison. I am sure he still means to
              impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill, which I
              design for somebody else. I must come to an understanding with him. I must make him
              know that I will not be tricked on the south side of Everingham, any more than on the
              north: that I will be master of my own property. I was not explicit enough with him
              before. The mischief such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of his
              employer and the welfare of the poor, is inconceivable. I have a great mind to go back
              into Norfolk directly, and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot be
              afterwards swerved from. Maddison is a clever fellow; I do not wish to displace him,
              provided he does not try to displace <em>me</em>; but it would be simple
              to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me, and worse than simple to
              let him give me a hard-hearted, griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man,
              to whom I have given half a promise already. Would it not be worse than simple? Shall
              I go? Do you advise it?"</span>

            be no longer detained. He pressed her hand, looked at her, and was gone. <em>He</em> went to while away the next three hours as he could, with his
            other acquaintance, till the best dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their
            enjoyment, and <em>she</em> turned in to her more simple one
            immediately.</span>

            different character; and could he have suspected how many privations, besides that of
            exercise, she endured in her father's house, he would have wondered that her looks were
            not much more affected than he found them. She was so little equal to Rebecca's puddings
            and Rebecca's hashes, brought to table, as they all were, with such accompaniments of
            half-cleaned plates, and not half-cleaned knives and forks, that she was very often
            constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could send her brothers in the evening
            for biscuits and buns. After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the day to
            be hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he known all, might have thought
            his niece in the most promising way of being starved, both mind and body, into a much
            juster value for Mr. Crawford's good company and good fortune, he would probably have
            feared to push his experiment farther, lest she might die under the cure.</span>

            being low.</span>

            It was parting with
            somebody of the nature of a friend; and though, in one light, glad to have him gone, it
            seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation from
            Mansfield;</span>

            returning to town, and being frequently with Mary and Edmund, without feelings so near

            anything passing around her; a friend or two of her father's, as always happened if he
            was not with them, spent the long, long evening there; and from six o'clock till
            half-past nine, there was little intermission of noise or grog. She was very low. The
            wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr. Crawford was the nearest to
            administering comfort of anything within the current of her thoughts. Not considering in
            how different a circle she had been just seeing him, nor how much might be owing to
            contrast,</span>

            And, if in little
            things, must it not be so in great? So anxious for her health and comfort, so very
            feeling as he now expressed himself, and really seemed, might not it be fairly supposed
            that he would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her?</span>
