                        very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme. She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated. It was three weeks since she had
                        heard at all.</span>

                                    letters in such a place as Bath. You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know, affords
                                    little to write about. We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the
                                    holidays. I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody. The holidays, however, are over at last: I believe no children ever had
                                    such long ones. I am sure I had not. The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles; but you will be
                                    surprised to hear they have never gone home. Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long. I do not
                                    understand it. They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not
                                    better, than her grandchildren. What dreadful weather we have had! It may not be felt in Bath, with your nice pavements; but
                                    in the country it is of some consequence. I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January, except
                                    Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome. Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did
                                    not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way. The carriage is gone to-day, to bring
                                    Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow. We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove</span>

                                    so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,</span>
                                <span id="said_no_01934" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mary Musgrove" data-placement="auto top">which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;
                                    and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow. I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I
                                    could be acquainted with him too; but I have my usual luck: I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on;
                                    always the last of my family to be noticed. What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth! Does she never
                                    mean to go away? But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited. Let me know what you think of
                                    this. I do not expect my children to be asked, you know. I can leave them at the Great House very well, for a month or six
                                    weeks.</span>

                                    this is really an instance of gross inattention. Charles joins me in love, and everything proper.</span>

                                    shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like. The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely hope Bath
                                    will do him all the good he wants. I shall be truly glad to have them back again. Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a
                                    pleasant family. But now for Louisa. I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little. She and the
                                    Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised not
                                    to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the
                                    reason? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had
                                    an answer from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away, and he had written to her
                                    father by Captain Harville. True, upon my honour! Are not you astonished? I shall be surprised at least if you ever received
                                    a hint of it, for I never did.</span>

                                    could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me. I hope he will be more agreeable now. Certainly not

                        meet with the Admiral. He was standing by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation of some

                            you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother. Shabby fellows, both of them! I am glad they are not on this side of the

                            another time. There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson. Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my
                            wife. Ah! the peace has come too soon for that younker. Poor old Sir Archibald! How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot? It suits us very
                            well. We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and
                            then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at Kellynch,
                            ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal. We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you, for putting us
                            in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth. The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way."</span>
