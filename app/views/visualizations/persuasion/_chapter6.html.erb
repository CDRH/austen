                        people to another, though at a distance of only three miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea. She
                        had never been staying there before, without being struck by it, or</span>

                        completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks, she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the
                        separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: "So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do
                        you think they will settle in?" and this, without much waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies' addition of, "I hope we shall be
                        in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us!" or in the
                        anxious supplement from Mary, of --"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!"</span>

                        nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else. He had very
                        good spirits, which never seemed much affected by his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's
                        admiration, and upon the whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share than she
                        wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass for a happy couple. They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more
                        money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority, for while

                        with her sister, she was continually requested, or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.</span>

                            those children. They are quite different creatures with you! But to be sure, in general they are so spoilt! It is a pity you cannot
                            put your sister in the way of managing them. They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen, poor little dears! without
                            partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated --! Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes. I assure you,
                            Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should. I believe Mrs Charles is not quite
                            pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be
                            checking every moment; "don't do this," and "don't do that;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good

                            take place of mamma. Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be more becoming in her not to be always
                            insisting on it. It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken notice of by many

                        their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to
                        be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage. It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every morning, and

                        appreciation or real taste. In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for
                        their own daughters' performance, and total indifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than

                        the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much
                        preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always
                        recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else, and often drew this compliment --"Well

                        means of her going. She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned. They came: the master
                        of the house was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the
                        Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a

                        and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have lived some
                        years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty. Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust of

                            or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while before
                            he died, poor fellow! And upon looking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be the
                            very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard! So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon
                            such gloomy things."</span>

                        had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome, hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year; that
                        he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his
                        family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death abroad
                        had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.</span>

                        him "poor Richard," been nothing better than a thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything to
                        entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name, living or dead.</span>

                        Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters which
                        his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;
                        all the rest had been mere applications for money.</span>

                        any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of
                        Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.</span>

                        likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and
                        afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.</span>
