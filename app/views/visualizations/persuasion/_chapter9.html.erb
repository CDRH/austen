                        as thoroughly the object of the Admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's. He had intended, on first arriving, to proceed very soon
                        into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off. There was
                        so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the
                        young so agreeable, that</span>

                        where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of Edward's wife upon credit a little longer.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00835" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day. The Musgroves could hardly be more
                        ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were
                        generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about in a
                        way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig, lately added to their establishment.</span>

                        their dependencies. It was unvarying, warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established, when a

                        very much in the way.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00841" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable, pleasing young
                        man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's introduction. He
                        was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father's house, only two miles
                        from Uppercross. A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period, and when he came
                        back he had the pain of finding very altered manners, and of seeing Captain Wentworth.</span>

                        had made a material difference in their degree of consequence. Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was insignificant compared
                        with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would, from their
                        parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at all, but
                        for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was
                        very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00843" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride on one side,
                        and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased to improve their
                        cousins. Charles's attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00846" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but from that time
                        Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.</span>

                        discretion of both their daughters, and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its chance. There
                        was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage: the young
                        couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss
                        Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to
                        which was the one liked best. Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing that</span>

                            Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war. Here was a fortune at
                            once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as
                            likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy. Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters."</span>

                            Henrietta would not dislike that. Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth! It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much

                            that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to those who have not
                            been used to them. And, pray, who is Charles Hayter? Nothing but a country curate. A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of
                            Uppercross."</span>

                            through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he
                            is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty property. The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred
                            and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best land in the country. I grant you, that any of them but
                            Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible; but he
                            is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of
                            it, and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible man -- good, freehold
                            property. No, no; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I

                            head, and I have very little doubt that he has. She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday. I wish you had been there to
                            see her behaviour. And as to Captain Wentworth's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he certainly does

                        Charles. She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the

                        as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause. He had been absent only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her
                        interested, even to the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross
                        instead. It had then seemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00883" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his

                        fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.
                        The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a
                        better curacy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's being relieved from the duty which he could no
                        longer get through without most injurious fatigue,</span>

                        he came back, alas! the zeal of the business was gone by. Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had
                        just held with Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided
                        attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.</span>

                        present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles, who was
                        lying on the sofa.</span>

                            as well as herself.</span>

                        hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy --
                        Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of

                        conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the newspaper; and
                        Captain Wentworth returned to his window.</span>

                        child, of two years old, having got the door opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and went
                        straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.</span>

                        him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was about Charles, she
                        could not shake him off. She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain. Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy
                        had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.</span>
