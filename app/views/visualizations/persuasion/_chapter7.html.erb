                        had called on him, and come back warm in his praise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by the end of another
                        week. It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was he to shew his
                        gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars. But a
                        week must pass;</span>

                        roused the most alarming ideas. It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to send for, the
                        father to have pursued and informed, the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest child to
                        banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the other
                        house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00594" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care of his wife; and the
                        second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary. Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the worse for being
                        vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt and felt,
                        and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be able
                        to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then it was, just before they parted, that</span>

                        had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had
                        promised in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow -- actually on the morrow;
                        and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought. And in short, he had
                        looked and said everything with such exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00601" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently more full of Captain

                            not a creature coming near us all the evening! I knew how it would be. This is always my luck. If there is anything disagreeable
                            going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles is as bad as any of them. Very unfeeling! I must say it is very unfeeling
                            of him to be running away from his poor little boy. Talks of his being going on so well! How does he know that he is going on well,
                            or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence? I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling. So here he is to
                            go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit
                            than anybody else to be about the child. My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried. I am not at all
                            equal to it. You saw how hysterical I was yesterday."</span>

                            have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband. Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province. A sick

                        should not have known her again!"</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00689" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">These were words which could not but dwell with her. Yet she soon began to rejoice that
                        she had heard them.</span>

                        sobering tendency; they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00691" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but without an idea
                        that they would be carried round to her. He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had spoken as he
                        felt.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00692" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar_went" data-placement="auto top">He had not forgiven
                        Anne Elliot. She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which
                        his own decided, confident temper could not endure. She had given him up to oblige others. It had been the effect of over-persuasion. It
                        had been weakness and timidity.</span>

                        warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation of
                        curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again. Her power with him was gone for ever.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00694" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was now his object to marry. He was rich, and being turned on shore, fully intended
                        to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head
                        and a quick taste could allow.</span>

                        either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting
                        Anne Elliot.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00696" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">This was his only secret exception, when he said to his sister, in answer to her

                            fifteen and thirty may have me for asking. A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost
                            man. Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society among women to make him nice?"</span>

                        he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with. "A
                        strong mind, with sweetness of manner," made the first and the last of the description.</span>
