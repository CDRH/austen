                        their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge.</span>

                        Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of
                        tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she might be able
                        to bear the removal home; and her father and mother, who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas
                        holidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.</span>

                        been all in lodgings together. Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs Harville's children away as much as she could, every possible supply from
                        Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to
                        dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and
                        hospitable.</span>

                        had found more to enjoy than to suffer. Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01452" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar_mary" data-placement="auto top">when they dined with
                        the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then,
                        she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much going on every
                        day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library, and changed them so
                        often, that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme. She had been taken to Charmouth too, and she had bathed, and she had
                        gone to church, and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01453" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">and all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful, had made really an agreeable

                            not know what he would be at. We asked him to come home with us for a day or two: Charles undertook to give him some shooting, and
                            he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward
                            sort of excuse;</span>

                            that he did not mean to come. I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively

                            everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he
                            had not courage to come. That is the fact, upon my honour, Mary knows it is."</span>

                        Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to
                        Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed. Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard. She boldly
                        acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her enquiries.</span>
