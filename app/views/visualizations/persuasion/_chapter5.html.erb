                        and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral's side, as
                        could not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by</span>

                        rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and certainly not
                        sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.</span>

                        consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should be

                        present an idea of the kind. Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe

                        pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been.</span>

                            than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all
                            inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people. And as to my father, I really should not have thought that he, who
                            has kept himself single so long for our sakes, need be suspected now. If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might
                            be wrong to have her so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a degrading match,
                            but he might be rendered unhappy. But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I
                            really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety. One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her
                            personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times. That tooth of her's and those freckles. Freckles do not disgust me so very
                            much as they do him. I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few, but he abominates them. You must have heard him notice

                        the old English style, containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the mansion of the
                        squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees, substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage, enclosed in its
                        own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it had received
                        the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French windows,
                        and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of

                        Kellynch. The two families were so continually meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house at all hours,
                        that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of
                        course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary had not Anne's understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and properly
                        attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits; but any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources for
                        solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of
                        fancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the
                        dignity of being "a fine girl." She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of
                        which had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her

                        square parlour, with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air
                        of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction. Oh! could the originals of
                        the portraits against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have
                        been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness! The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment.</span>

                        The father and mother were in the old English style, and the young people in the new. Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very good sort of
                        people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated, and not at all elegant. Their children had more modern minds and manners. There was
                        a numerous family; but the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had
                        brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies, living to be
                        fashionable, happy, and merry. Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely good, their
                        manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad. Anne always contemplated them as some of the
                        happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the
                        possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them
                        nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had
                        known so little herself with either of her sisters.</span>

                        House family, which was generally, as Anne very well knew, the least to blame. The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough; and she
                        was not at all surprised at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's particular
                        invitation.</span>
