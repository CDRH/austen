                        had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became a matter
                        of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street. She had promised to be with the Musgroves from
                        breakfast to dinner. Her faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot's character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head, must live another
                        day.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02660" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">She could not keep her appointment punctually, however; the weather was unfavourable,
                        and she had grieved over the rain on her friends' account, and felt it very much on her own, before she was able to attempt the walk.
                        When she reached the White Hart, and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself neither arriving quite in time, nor the
                        first to arrive. The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and</span>

                        Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02663" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">and</span>

                        injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02666" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">She had only to submit, sit down, be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at
                        once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed. There was no delay, no
                        waste of time. She was deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such happiness, instantly. Two minutes after her entering
                        the room, Captain Wentworth said --</span>

                        to them all, was engrossed by writing.</span>

                        just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper. Anne felt that she did not
                        belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing many
                        undesirable particulars; such as,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02670" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mrs. Musgrove" data-placement="auto top">"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what
                        my brother Hayter had said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the
                        young people had wished, and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very
                        well,"</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02671" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication: minutiae which, even
                        with every advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give, could be properly interesting only to the
                        principals. Mrs Croft was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it was very sensibly.</span>

                            fair to stand out any longer, for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near as bad; and so we thought
                            they had better marry at once, and make the best of it, as many others have done before them. At any rate, said I, it will be better
                            than a long engagement."</span>

                        a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table, Captain Wentworth's
                        pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing, listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one quick, conscious
                        look at her.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02687" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths, and enforce them
                        with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothing distinctly;
                        it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in confusion.</span>

                        to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him, though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he was inviting
                        her to join him where he stood. He looked at her with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02689" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Captain Harville" data-placement="auto top">"Come to me, I have something to say;"</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02690" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older
                        acquaintance than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation. She roused herself and went to him. The window at which he stood was
                        at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain Wentworth's table, not very near. As
                        she joined him, Captain Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character.</span>

                            and grieving for him? I little thought then -- but no matter. This was drawn at the Cape. He met with a clever young German artist
                            at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the
                            charge of getting it properly set for another! It was a commission to me! But who else was there to employ? I hope I can allow for
                            him. I am not sorry, indeed, to make it over to another. He undertakes it;"</span>

                            forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world

                        I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you
                        fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have
                        penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can
                        distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You
                        do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.</span>

                        direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a
                        blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow. There

                        so many, many years of division and estrangement. There they returned again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their
                        re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth,
                        and attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting. And there, as they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group
                        around them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers, flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could
                        indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present
                        moment, which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest. All the little variations of the last week were gone through; and of

                            been one person more my enemy even than that lady? My own self. Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few
                            thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you, would you have answered my letter? Would you, in
                            short, have renewed the engagement then?"</span>

                            crown all my other success; but I was proud, too proud to ask again. I did not understand you. I shut my eyes, and would not
                            understand you, or do you justice. This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself. Six years of
                            separation and suffering might have been spared. It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me. I have been used to the
                            gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed. I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards.
