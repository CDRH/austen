                            have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with. Therefore, Sir

                            contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from
                            the notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for
                            nobody would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to
                            elude; and therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the
                            truth should get abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications will unquestionably follow, I
                            should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add, that two hours will bring

                            of the pleasure-grounds, is another thing. I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable; and I should

                            to it. First, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their
                            fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old
                            sooner than any other man. I have observed it all my life. A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of
                            one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any
                            other line. One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives,
                            whose father we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain
                            Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged to the
                            last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top. 'In the name of heaven, who

                            of youth. But then, is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other? Soldiers, in active service, are not at all
                            better off: and even in the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the body, which seldom leaves a

                            necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way,
