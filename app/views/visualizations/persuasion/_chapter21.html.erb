                        meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a
                        first object.</span>

                        attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard, perhaps compassion.</span>

                        he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation, by his own sentiments, by his early prepossession. It was altogether very
                        extraordinary; flattering, but painful. There was much to regret.</span>

                        along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings. It was almost enough to spread
                        purification and perfume all the way.</span>

                        concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it. All that she could tell she told most
                        gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had already heard,
                        through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter, rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate,
                        and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company. Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by
                        name to Mrs Smith.</span>

                            towards him. Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced. Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a
                            designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty,
                            or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character. He has no feeling for others. Those whom he has
                            been the chief cause of leading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction. He is totally beyond the
                            reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion. Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!"</span>

                            friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and thought him as good as himself. The intimacy had been formed before our
                            marriage. I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest
                            opinion of him. At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and
                            much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost always together. We were principally in town, living in very good style. He
                            was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do
                            to support the appearance of a gentleman. He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a
                            brother. My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his last farthing with him; and
                            I know that his purse was open to him; I know that he often assisted him."</span>

                            I will now explain. If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable, stop me. My account states,

                            Walter as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a
                            clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea,
                            among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently,
                            blind to the danger."</span>

                            you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in
                            Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to
                            Bath for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of
                            things, and the reports beginning to prevail. Now you are to understand, that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's
                            opinions as to the value of a baronetcy. Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man. Having long had as
                            much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his
                            happiness upon the consequence he is heir to. I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed
                            feeling. He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William. You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could
                            not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing
                            himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might
                            give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material. This was agreed
                            upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could. He was to be
                            introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced. Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on
                            application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object
                            (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay. He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw
                            himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject. You can imagine what an artful man would
                            do; and with this guide, perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do."</span>

                            will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do. My line of conduct will
                            be more direct. Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to guide him
                            than selfishness."</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02457" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">But Mr Elliot was not done with. Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first
                        direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied against him; but her
                        attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify
                        the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith, proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in
                        justice and compassion.</span>
                </p>

                    <span id="said_no_02458" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot's
                        marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune. Mrs Smith did
                        not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income had
                        never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance. From
                        his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong
                        understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him, led by him, and probably despised by him. Mr Elliot, raised by
                        his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving
                        himself, (for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have
                        found himself to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been
                        prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02459" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it. They had
                        previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better not be tried;
                        but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known. With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard, more
                        creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act, and the
                        difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her, in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such
                        as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to without corresponding indignation.</span>

                        Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold civility, the same
                        hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her. It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity; and</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02463" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">She had a great deal to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the
                        minutiae of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural
                        indulgence. Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her
                        friend's usual state of mind.</span>
                </p>

                    <span id="said_no_02464" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation.
                        She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been for many years under a sort of
                        sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this property, though not large,
                        would be enough to make her comparatively rich. But there was nobody to stir in it. Mr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing
                        herself, equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money. She
                        had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law. This
                        was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means. To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little trouble in the
                        right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims, was hard to bear.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_02465" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices with Mr Elliot.
                        She had previously, in the anticipation of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on being assured that
                        he could have made no attempt of that nature, since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that something
                        might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings, as
                        far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow, when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of
                        everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the
                        comfort of telling the whole story her own way.</span>

                        surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_02467" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Anne Elliot" data-placement="auto top">"She had seemed to recommend and praise him!"</span>

                        he might not yet have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he had been your husband. My heart bled for
                        you, as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless. He
                        was very unkind to his first wife. They were wretched together. But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved
                        her. I was willing to hope that you must fare better."</span>
