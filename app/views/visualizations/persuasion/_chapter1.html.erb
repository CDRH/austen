                        amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one;
                        there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by</span>

                        pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he
                        could read his own history with an interest which never failed. This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:</span>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.</p>
                    <p>"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of
                        Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son,
                        November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."</p>
                    
                </blockquote>

                    <span id="said_no_00005" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's hands; but Sir
                        Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's
                            birth—<blockquote><p>"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of
                            Somerset,"</p></blockquote> and by
                        inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00006" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family, in the usual
                        terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire; how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff, representing a borough
                        in three successive parliaments, exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with all the Marys and
                        Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and
                            motto:—<blockquote><p>"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,"</p></blockquote> and Sir Walter's handwriting again in this
                        finale:--</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00007" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character; vanity of person
                        and of situation. He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man. Few women could think
                        more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in
                        society.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00008" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">He considered</span>

                        of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00010" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his
                        warmest respect and devotion.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00011" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must
                        have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own. Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and
                        amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required
                        indulgence afterwards. -- She had humoured, or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for seventeen
                        years; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children, to
                        attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them. -- Three girls, the two eldest
                        sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of
                        a conceited, silly father. She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong
                        attachment to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for
                        the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00012" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been anticipated on that
                        head by their acquaintance. Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near neighbours and intimate
                        friends, and one remained a widower, the other a widow.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_00013" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should
                        have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman
                        does marry again, than when she does not; but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation. Be it known then, that Sir
                        Walter, like a good father, (having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00014" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">prided himself on</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00015" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar_sirwalt" data-placement="auto top">remaining
                        single for his dear daughters' sake.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00016" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing, which he had not
                        been very much tempted to do. Elizabeth had succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights and consequence; and
                        being very handsome, and very like himself, her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most happily.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00017" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_7" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar_sirwalt" data-placement="auto top">His two other
                        children were of very inferior value. Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00018" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">but</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00024" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter, favourite,
                        and friend. Lady Russell loved them all; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00025" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished
                        early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and
                        mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem.</span>

                        of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large
                        fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00029" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years
                        before; and, generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is
                        lost. It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and</span>

                        seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of
                        her being younger than she was. For thirteen years had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home, and leading
                        the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.
                        Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs
                        shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world. She had the
                        remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;</span>

                        sister, made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it open on the table near her, had she closed it, with
