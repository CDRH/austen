                        being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning to think how
                        her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.</span>

                        in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and there must be
                        intercourse between the two families. This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in
                        removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,</span>

                        interesting question, be the gainer, almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady

                        possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall: those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought
                        too painfully before her;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01080" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth
                        never meeting anywhere.</span>

                        each other, and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she might think that he
                        had too much self-possession, and she too little.</span>
                </p>

                    <span id="said_no_01082" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross,
                        where she felt</span>

                        stationed quite long enough. Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit
                        there, but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01084" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way which she had not at all
                        imagined. Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them to justify
                        himself by a relation of what had kept him away.</span>

                        friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled with his family at
                        Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other. Captain Harville had never been in
                        good health since a severe wound which he received two years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him had determined him to go
                        immediately to Lyme. He had been there for four-and-twenty hours.</span>

                        Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither was the
                        consequence.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01088" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">The young people were all wild to see Lyme.</span>

                        himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad;</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01091" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">and, in short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the resolution
                        to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down all
                        the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer; and to Lyme they were to go -- Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta,
                        Louisa, and Captain Wentworth.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01092" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night; but to this
                        Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the middle of
                        November would not leave much time for seeing a new place, after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for going
                        and returning. They were, consequently, to stay the night there, and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner. This was felt
                        to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very
                        punctually, it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle,
                        in which he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and entering upon the still steeper street of the town
                        itself, that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were
                        gone.</span>
                </p>

                    <span id="said_no_01093" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns, the next thing
                        to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea. They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which
                        Lyme, as a public place, might offer. The rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents
                        left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost
                        hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing
                        machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to
                        the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the
                        immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better. The scenes in its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and
                        extensive sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands,
                        make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful
                        village of Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards
                        of luxuriant growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the
                        ground for such a state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of
                        the far-famed Isle of Wight: these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the worth of Lyme understood.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01094" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms,
                        and still descending, soon found themselves on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the
                        sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all, proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth's
                        account: for in a small house, near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled. Captain Wentworth turned in to
                        call on his friend; the others walked on, and he was to join them on the Cobb.</span>
                </p>

                    <span id="said_no_01095" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa seemed to
                        feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long, when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well known
                        already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="said_no_01096" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia; and the account
                        which Captain Wentworth had given of him, on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an
                        officer, whom he had always valued highly, which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a
                        little history of his private life, which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01097" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar_went" data-placement="auto top">He had been engaged
                        to Captain Harville's sister, and was now mourning her loss. They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion. Fortune
                        came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it. She had died
                        the preceding summer while he was at sea.</span>

                        impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the
                        dreadful change.</span>

                        of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for
                        reading, and sedentary pursuits.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01102" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">To finish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the Harvilles
                        seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them
                        entirely. Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to
                        a residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly
                        adapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind. The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick was very great.</span>

                        prospects so blighted for ever. He is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man. He will rally again, and
                        be happy with another."</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01106" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">They all met, and were introduced. Captain Harville was a tall, dark man, with a
                        sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from strong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain Wentworth.
                        Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them, a little man. He had a pleasing face and
                        a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.</span>

                        gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging. Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the same good
                        feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because the

                        already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth
                        should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_01108" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such a bewitching
                        charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality and
                        display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01109" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Anne Elliot" data-placement="auto top">"These would have been all my friends,"</span>

                        small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many. Anne had a moment's astonishment on the
                        subject herself; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice
                        arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of lodging-house furniture,
                        and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected. The varieties in the fitting-up of the rooms, where the
                        common necessaries provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of
                        wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited, were
                        more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his
                        habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.</span>

                        fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick. His lameness prevented
                        him from taking much exercise; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within. He drew, he
                        varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements; and if
                        everything else was done, sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.</span>

                        having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers. He ventured
                        among them again, however, though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general.</span>

                        recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed rather
                        apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him. He was shy, and
                        disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne
                        was well repaid the first trouble of exertion. He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading, though principally in
                        poetry; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual
                        companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of
                        struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out of their conversation. For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had
                        rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of the present age,
                        and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake
                        were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he showed
                        himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of
                        the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,
                        and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry, and</span>

                        was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in
                        his daily study; and on being requested to particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such collections of the finest
                        letters, such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind
