                        been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,</span>

                        satisfied neither husband nor wife; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she could not but think, as far as she
                        might dare to judge from memory and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00923" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar_anne" data-placement="auto top">They were more in
                        love with him; yet there it was not love. It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with some.
                        Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00924" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about, and of
                        pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to. She did not attribute guile to any. It was the highest satisfaction to
                        her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning.</span>

                        triumph, no pitiful triumph in his manner. He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter. He was only
                        wrong in accepting the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.</span>

                        passed without his coming once to Uppercross; a most decided change. He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner; and having
                        been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him,</span>

                        a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters from the

                        who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early. Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready for this
                        walk, and they entered into it with pleasure. Could Anne have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from some
                        feelings of interest and curiosity,</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00955" class="said intro_to_fid said_tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">she fancied now that</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00957" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves,
                        who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance.</span>

                    <span id="said_no_00958" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the narrow paths across
                        the fields made many separations necessary, to keep with her brother and sister. Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise
                        and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some
                        few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and
                        tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.
                        She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach of
                        Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves, she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very
                        remarkable. It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing, might fall into.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00959" class="said fid said_tooltip certainty_5" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar_anne" data-placement="auto top">He was more engaged
                        with Louisa than with Henrietta. Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_00960" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="aus.002.nar" data-placement="auto top">This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech of Louisa's which struck
                        her. After one of the many praises of the day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added:--</span>

                            drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills. They talked of coming into this side of the country. I wonder
                            whereabouts they will upset to-day. Oh! it does happen very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as
                            lieve be tossed out as not."</span>

                            as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than
                            driven safely by anybody else."</span>

                            were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet, fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining happiness,
                            and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together, blessed her memory. She roused herself to say, as they struck by

                        ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring
                        again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the

                            made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as

                        where many divisions were necessary, or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two. In a long
                        strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of
                        the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged. She joined Charles and Mary, and was tired
                        enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm; but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper with his wife.</span>

                        every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began to complain of it, and lament her
                        being ill-used, according to custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other, he dropped the arms of
                        both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.</span>

                        and when the party had all reached the gate of exit, the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time heard, was
                        just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig. He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home. Upon
