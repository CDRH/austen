                            thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being in love with Mrs Clay;
                            and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at home a few hours. On going down to breakfast the next morning,</span>

                        stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself. Her countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise of the fine mind
                        did not appear to excite a thought in her sister. The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay.</span>

                            recommendation, and you see what it has done for her. You see how it has carried away her freckles."</span>

                        take its chance. The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also to marry. As for herself, she might always
                        command a home with Lady Russell.</span>

                        her intercourse in Camden Place. The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation to her
                        there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has a very
                        large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.</span>

                        knowledge of the world, and a warm heart. He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he
                        lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he judged for himself in everything essential, without defying public
                        opinion in any point of worldly decorum. He was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness,
                        which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of
                        domestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.</span>

                        among all sensible people, to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head
                        naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of youth.</span>

                        the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of
                        ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount, when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's at the same time,
                        there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch. No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland. The neglect had been visited on the
                        head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there
                        was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed. How to have this anxious business set to
                        rights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question: and it was a question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell
                        nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant.</span>
                    <span id="said_no_01746" class="said" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lady Russell" data-placement="auto top">"Family connexions were always worth preserving, good company always worth seeking;
                        Lady Dalrymple had taken a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style. She had been at Bath the year before,
                        and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman. It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed, if it could be
                        done, without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots."</span>

                        ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his right honourable cousin. Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter; but
                        it did all that was wanted, in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.</span>

                        There was no superiority of manner, accomplishment, or understanding. Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of "a charming woman,"
                        because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody. Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so awkward, that she
